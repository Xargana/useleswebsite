Going into 2023, the collective yearning for connection hasn’t gone away. Despite the initial reticence, many have embraced the paradigm-shifting opportunities the digital community offers. “After three years of COVID, everybody is super ready for a hyper-virtual world,” says Moran Kadussi, who tracks global digital trends at Wix. "You can do more things in the virtual sphere than you thought you could before.”</p> <p>As a business owner, you probably want to know how to best approach your marketing strategy with the future in mind. To anticipate which <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/12/marketing-strategies/" target="_blank" >marketing strategies</a> will carry through 2023, we spoke to industry experts about the marketing trends you can implement and get ahead of the curve:</p> <h2>Marketing Trends to Embrace in 2023: </h2><ol> <li>Interactive content marketing</li> <li>AI marketing</li> <li>Live streaming </li> <li>Long-term influencer partnerships</li> <li>Promoting users over products</li> <li>Media marketing</li> </ol> <h3>01. Interactive content marketing</h3> <p>With governments tightening GDPR laws and tech giants cracking down on third-party cookies, marketers are set to lose a heck of a lot of data. This may explain why interactive content such as quizzes is all the rage right now—brands can gather psychographic data less invasively. According to a 2022 survey of 1,600 marketers, 45% said <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing" target="_blank" >interactive content</a> was the type of content they used the most on social media and 77% said it was the most effective.</p> <p>Besides the data-collection benefits, interactive content also engages consumers. Data from over 230,000 sales and marketing professionals shows that interactive content receives <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-research-reveals-207-spike-in-digital-sales-content-consumption-during-the-pandemic-with-interactive-content-seeing-a-94-higher-increase-in-engagement-than-static-content-301488063.html" target="_blank" >28% more views than static content</a>. Plus, the average person spends 4.6 more minutes watching interactive content than static content. </p> <p>Here are a few examples of interactive content to implement into your marketing strategy in 2023:</p> <ul> <li>Games</li> <li>Quizzes</li> <li>Calculators</li> <li>Polls</li> <li>Virtual reality</li> <li>Surveys</li> <li>Dynamic presentations</li> <li>Explainer videos</li> <li>Simulations</li> <li>Software demos</li> <li>Image sliders</li> <li>Interactive maps</li> <li>Interactive infographics</li> </ul> <h2>02. AI marketing</h2> <p>Ross Simmonds, CEO of <a href="https://foundationinc.co/" target="_blank" >Foundation</a>, told <em>Marketing Millennials</em>, “In 2023, I think we’re going to see major campaigns be run on the back of AI-generated creative and content.” You’ve likely noticed this trend yourself, with DALL·E 2 images flooding social media over the past few months. Indeed, the Business Research Company expects the global <a href="https://www.reportlinker.com/p06319258/Artificial-Intelligence-In-Marketing-Global-Market-Report.html?utm_source=GNW" target="_blank" >artificial intelligence in marketing</a> market to grow from $17.46 billion in 2022 to $48.91 billion in 2026. </p> <p>May Habib, the co-founder and CEO of an AI-writing platform called <a href="https://writer.com/" target="_blank" >Writer</a>, explains that intelligent tools can make the content creation process dramatically more efficient, whether you’re <a href="https://www.wix.com/start/blog" target="_blank" >creating a blog</a> or just trying to write a few paragraphs for your About Us page. “AI-assisted drafting doubled search volume for Emotive within a month,” she says about one of her customers. “They would’ve needed to spend six months outsourcing to an agency to get the same search impact that one writer working with our product did.”</p> <p><strong>Tip</strong>: Use Wix’s AI <a href="https://www.wix.com/tools/title-generator" target="_blank" >title generator</a> to get ideas for blog posts and newsletters.</p> <p> </p><h2>03. Live streaming</h2> <p>After serving as a salve for isolation during COVID lockdowns, live streams became ubiquitous in marketing. Video gaming made the concept popular, but it has evolved to include all sorts of content, from eSports competitions and concerts to interviews and tutorials. Marketers have taken note and will be <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/hubfs/2022_State-of-Inbound-Marketing-Trends_V08122022.pdf" target="_blank" >investing big in live streaming</a> in 2023, especially in Twitter Spaces and Instagram Live Rooms. </p> <p>Melinda Lee, the chief content officer of a live-commerce platform called <a href="https://stageten.tv/" target="_blank" >Stage TEN</a>, thinks live-streaming's communal nature has made it so popular among consumers and marketers alike. “You see the community watching and engaging with the streamer but also engaging with each other,” she explains. Because of all that enthusiastic participation, your shows can end up serving as impromptu <a href="https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/focus-group" target="_blank" >focus groups</a>. “The whole time, you’re gathering data on what it is that people want to know about the product, the questions they ask, what would attract them to a live stream,” says Lee. She recommends incorporating prompts for feedback into broadcasts.</p> <p>Live streaming has a minimal barrier to entry—you need minimal equipment and tech savvy to undertake this form of digital marketing. Plus, you can always reformat the recordings for other content. All in all, hosting live streams can <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/10/how-to-drive-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" >drive traffic to your website</a> and connect with your <a href="https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/target-market" target="_blank" >target market</a>.</p> <p><strong>Tip</strong>: Free Wix users can broadcast up to ten minutes in a single stream on Wix’s <a href="https://www.wix.com/tools/video-maker" target="_blank" >video maker</a> and premium users can broadcast up to three hours.</p> <h2>04. Long-term influencer partnership</h2> <p>Influencers are excellent at fostering parasocial relationships in which their audience feels likes part of their lives. Marketers wanting to capitalize on those connections have started to tap into the real potential of <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2019/08/what-is-influencer-marketing/" target="_blank" >influencer marketing</a> by weaving their companies into the fabric of those relationships.</p> <p>Rather than paying a bunch of influencers to post about the business a couple of times, brands are investing in long-term partnerships with a smaller number of influencers. They’re also prioritizing quality over quantity when deciding which influencers to work with. “I’m seeing a lot more thought going into–not just how big the creator’s audience is, but whether they’re a fit for the brand,” says Lee. </p> <p>Shachaf Rodberg, Wix's marketing trend analyst, thinks Webflow has done a great job of building a long-term influencer partnership strategy. “People started doing Webflow tutorials on YouTube, and Webflow started sponsoring them because they want to amplify their voices and because they’re doing their job for them,” he explains. The SaaS company also features a few of those creators on Webflow TV, their educational streaming platform. </p> <h2>05. Promoting users over products</h2> <p>Marketers work to better facilitate interaction between customers and amplify community-generated content. That could mean running forums, featuring user-generated content on social media, posting testimonials on websites or initiating a referral reward program.</p> <p>Some companies are going as far as acquiring community-based companies. A product management company called <a href="https://www.pendo.io/news/pendo-announces-acquisition-of-mind-the-product-the-worlds-largest-community-of-product-managers/" target="_blank" >Pendo</a> acquired Mind the Product—a community made up of over 300,000 product managers, designers and developers—earlier this year.</p> <p>A community-led marketing strategy is most effective when community is built into the business itself. For example, Figma offers a ton of templates, most of which come from users themselves. This feature emphasizes the brand’s identity as a facilitator of collaboration. Figma also sponsors and supports local groups through a company initiative called <a href="https://friends.figma.com/" target="_blank" >Friends of Figma</a>. By fostering community, Figma deepens brand loyalty and facilitates <a href="https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/word-of-mouth-wom-marketing" target="_blank" >word-of-mouth marketing</a>.</p> <p><strong>Tip</strong>: Use <a href="https://www.wix.com/app-market/wix-forum#:~:text=Wix%20Forum%20Overview&#38;text=Use%20your%20forum%20as%20a,This%20app%20is%20available%20worldwide." target="_blank" >Wix Forums</a> to start discussions with your clients and Wix’s <a href="https://www.wix.com/ascend/social-media-graphics" target="_blank" >social media graphics</a> designer to style user-generated content to fit your brand’s design language.</p> <h2>06. Media marketing</h2> <p>As you may have gathered from the six other trends discussed thus far, media is no longer a facet of marketing—it’s fundamental to modern marketing. Whether it’s a <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2019/10/best-marketing-blogs/" target="_blank" >marketing blog</a> or a YouTube channel, media is a must for your marketing strategy. “Companies are understanding that their customers have other needs and challenges and things they care about, which are mostly not the company or the product,” said Rodberg. “It’s about how the company can help solve those needs or provide value in other aspects other than the product itself.”</p> <p>Consider Red Bull—a marketing empire that just so happens to sell an energy drink in a few flavors. In addition to owning a handful of sports teams, an athletic sponsorship business and a travel agency, <a href="https://www.generalist.com/briefing/red-bull" target="_blank" >Red Bull also has a small media conglomerate</a> made of magazines, content sites, a record label, TV shows and movies. All that media not only pulls in profits of its own, but it also makes Red Bull—a company worth over $7 billion—a household name. </p> <p>Red Bull is an extreme example, but most companies these days invest in some form of media marketing or another. <a href="https://www.eater.com/22665350/the-infatuation-zagat-acquired-by-jp-morgan-chase-bank" target="_blank" >Banks are acquiring food publications</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@werenotreallystrangers" target="_blank" >game creators have millions of TikTok followers</a> and <a href="https://trapital.co/2021/10/18/why-cash-app-launched-cash-app-studios-and-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" >apps are bankrolling artists</a> because they know thatto get customers, they need an audience. “People are either looking for entertainment, education or connection,” said Rodberg. “If you are not creating those things and you only create ads, people just won’t react.” </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_2a0d09728dba463da9d4f62042fa084a~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_60,h_60,al_c,q_80/file.png" ></figure><p><strong>By Emily Shwake</strong></p> <p>Wix Blog Writer</p> ]]>

While your website should educate, it should also actively help visitors achieve their goals. </p> <p>Your customer will visit your website with unique intentions, and you must consider how they’ll experience your site. To shape your site to create the best outcome for both you and visitors, user journey maps can tremendously benefit the design process. </p> <p>In the following guide, we’ll look at what a user journey map is and the benefits of using them for your <a href="https://www.wix.com/website/design" target="_blank" >website design</a>—plus we’ll detail the steps you need to create one. </p> <h2>What is a user journey map? </h2> <p>A user journey map, also referred to as a customer journey map, is a diagram that depicts a user’s interactions with a product over time. Typically represented by a flow chart, user journey maps are a common <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/07/what-is-ux-design/" target="_blank" >UX design</a> research and planning tool.</p> <p>Anyone designing a website can create journey maps to improve their site’s user experience. Typically, UX designers complete the research and planning involved in user journey mapping before they design a website for the following reasons: </p> <p><strong>It’s a strategic exercise:</strong> User journey mapping gets you thinking about who your visitors are, their goals and what they want and need from your site to accomplish them. </p> <p><strong>Helps visualize the user flow:</strong> By visualizing your visitors’ steps throughout the site, you’ll understand their thought process as they work to achieve their goal. </p> <h2>What are the benefits of creating a user journey map?</h2> <p><a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2020/05/how-to-design-a-website/" target="_blank" >Designing a website </a>with user journey mapping is a user-centered method that will help you empathize more with the user when designing your site’s content and <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/05/information-architecture/" target="_blank" >information architecture</a>. Because user journey mapping allows you to anticipate visitors’ behaviors, your design will result in a more positive user experience. </p> <p>User journey maps will also help you with: </p> <h3>More confident decision-making</h3> <p>Journey mapping allows you to remove inefficiencies and mitigate risks as you visualize your customers’ experience.</p> <h3>Website optimization</h3> <p>Business owners can use user journey maps to influence visitors to click on CTAs and increase site conversions. </p> <h2>How to create a user journey map </h2> <p>With user journey mapping, you should understand who your visitors are, why they’re on your site, and what’s going to help them achieve their goals. The steps below will enable you to create a user journey map that anticipates your visitors’ needs and how they browse it: </p> <ol> <li>Get an app to help you map out your user’s journey</li> <li>Figure out who your ideal users are</li> <li>Create user personas</li> <li>Define the scope of the user journey map</li> <li>List the key phases and touchpoints</li> <li>Think about user goals and actions at each phase</li> <li>Make an empathy map for the user journey </li> <li>Anticipate problems along the journey </li> <li>Think about opportunities for optimization</li> <li>Collect data, review and revamp your journey maps</li> </ol><h3>01. Get an app to help you map out your user’s journey</h3> <p>While you could use a spreadsheet or a flow chart maker to create a user journey map, it’ll take more time than using a <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/06/ux-design-tools/" target="_blank" >UX tool</a> built specifically for user journey mapping. </p> <p>Use these tools to add and remove fields to your map, rearrange the steps and edit its visual appearance. Many times, you’ll have the option of starting from scratch or using a pre-made user journey template that suits your needs. </p> <h3>02. Figure out who your ideal users are</h3> <p>When starting a business, you usually have a general idea of your target audience. User journey mapping goes further to discover your niche. Typically, you’ll find your ideal segment of users at the intersection of what you’re good at, what you’re passionate about, and where there’s a growing demand for what you do. </p> <p>Go ahead and fill in the blanks: </p> <p>Experience: _______________________</p> <p>Passion: __________________________</p> <p>Demand: _________________________</p> <p>What sits at the intersection between all three? That’s your ideal customer.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ea6ac8_fc0311c4927445bb99622e2586a213f9~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_528,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="venn diagram representing the intersection between a user's experience, passion, and demand to find the niche of your user journey "></figure><h3>03. Create user personas</h3> <p>Once you’ve identified your ideal user, research them to better know who they are. Use your insights to create <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/creative/2020/02/how-to-create-a-user-persona-ux/" target="_blank" >user personas</a> that realistically communicate the people most likely to visit your site. </p> <p>User personas are fictional users who represent the needs, personality and goals of a larger archetypal user group. In addition to adding a “real” name and photo to user persona profiles, you’ll fill in details related to: </p> <ul> <li>Basic demographics</li> <li>Interests</li> <li>Professional or personal details</li> <li>Motivations</li> <li>Core needs</li> <li>Pain points</li> <li>Quotes that describe what they think or how they feel</li> </ul> <p>Many brands have numerous user personas. Create profiles for each of your target personas. When you’re done, choose one to start with and include them in your user journey map. </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ea6ac8_f20d81fdd15b47929adcfd61d5f2048e~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_547,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="user persona examples for creating a user journey map "></figure><p>If your brand is new or yet to launch, you might not have much existing data to pull from. You can use tools to learn about your ideal user, even if they’re not your current user:</p> <p><strong>User interviews:</strong> Round up interviewees who represent potential users, and ask them questions related to your brand. Keep in mind that this information needs to help you learn more about your average or potential user, as well as what kind of online experience will encourage them to sign up. </p> <p>For example, </p><ul> <li>What do you do for a living? </li> <li>Why did you start your business? </li> <li>Have you ever considered using a service like ours? Why? </li> <li>What would convince you to work with our services? Rank your top 3 reasons.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Social media listening:</strong> Social media is a powerful tool when creating user personas, since it helps you know potential users more personally. By gathering data on what your target users talk about, you’ll understand what motivates them to engage with other brands and can apply that to your site as well. </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ea6ac8_8c740e629a614c2b8bff9d5afa7762fd~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_547,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="user persona profile example for creating a a user journey map"></figure><h2>04. Define the scope of the user journey map</h2> <p>The more granular your user journey maps, the more precise your web design. You can (and should) create user journey maps for the different interactions customers have with your brand and your website. </p> <p>When mapping out the user journey for new visitors, focus on what their first site experience should look like as they discover more about your product. Once you have an initial interaction with a target user, build on it. With returnees, for example, think more about what long-term loyal customers want when they enter the site, such as checking out new products or rewards programs.</p> <p>Break down the scope of each interaction with the following details: </p> <p><strong>User: </strong>This is a segment of our user persona. For example, “it’s a lead we targeted on Facebook.”</p> <p><strong>Goal: </strong>What is the user’s goal during this particular visit? If the user found an ad advertising a discounted course, for example, their goal is to find out more about it. </p> <p><strong>User Flow:</strong> Provide a basic summary of how you expect this interaction to go. For example, you anticipate that a user who landed on your site through a Facebook ad will want to first read more details and then purchase your product.</p> <p>What follows in the user journey map will help you figure out what’s needed on your website to increase the likelihood that they will complete their purchase at the end of the visit. </p> <h3>05. List the key phases and touch points</h3> <p>By defining certain phases of the user journey, you’ll start visualizing in detail how users get to your site, why they arrived and how they’ll interact with it. Each phase outlined in your map should include the various touch points where these interactions happen. </p> <p>You can also think of these phases as your goals for their visit. </p> <ul> <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Visitors find your brand and site through a targeted Facebook ad. </li> <li><strong>Video:</strong> Visitors are brought to a <a href="https://www.wix.com/landing-page-builder" target="_blank" >landing page </a>of your site featuring a video that introduces your brand. </li> <li><strong>Learn: </strong>Visitors read more information about what you do and what they’re going to get from your offering. </li> <li><strong>Purchase:</strong> Visitors pay for your services with a simple two-step checkout process.</li> <li><strong>Email phase:</strong> Visitors receive a “thank you” email with relevant details to get started and stay in touch. </li> </ul> <p>As you fill in this part of the user journey map, consider the following questions:</p> <ul> <li><strong>What is the source of this website traffic? </strong>In other words, what lured in these users? You can optimize these off-site touch points to increase not only your quantity of traffic, but the quality of it, too. </li> </ul><ul> <li><strong>What is the first page they’ll see on your site?</strong> For this particular user journey, does it make sense for them to enter through the home page? Or is it better to take them to a dedicated landing page where they can focus on a specific product or service? </li> </ul><ul> <li><strong>Where should they end their journey? </strong>When considering the best (and most realistic) ending point for visitors, think about both their needs and your own goals. For example, after visitors learn about your brand, you probably want to take them straight to a purchase page with the goal of converting. However, what if a visitor isn’t ready to purchase? You can still hold on to that lead by leading them to sign up for your weekly newsletter. </li> </ul> <h3>06. Think about user goals and actions at each phase</h3> <p>Now that you’ve mapped the various phases, write out the user's specific goals for arriving at this touchpoint and what actions they’ll take to achieve it. Objective-setting will help you understand what drives your users forward and anticipate what most visitors want to happen when they get to each stage.</p> <p>For example: </p> <p><strong>Discovery: </strong>If I click this ad, I’ll see if this offer is as legitimate as it seems.</p> <p><strong>Video:</strong> If I watch this video, I’ll get a high-level overview of this course.</p> <p><strong>Learn: </strong>If I read through this page, the coach will address any doubts I have about this course. </p> <p><strong>Purchase:</strong> If I click this “Buy Now” button, I’ll be directed to checkout.</p> <p><strong>Email:</strong> If I open up my email, I can get started on the course right away.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ea6ac8_c656c9fed9ee40f2ad2ffa38abd12658~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_528,al_c,q_80/file.png" ></figure><h3>07. Make an empathy map for the user journey</h3> <p>A user’s emotions heavily influence their journey. If your website doesn’t elicit the right kind of emotional reaction—be it relief, joy, excitement, or something else—visitors might not end up where you want them to.</p> <p>A user journey map should reflect potential shifts in the user’s mood, behavior and thought process as they continue through each phase. This information allows you to determine the best way to use or influence that emotional state to help them accomplish their goals. </p> <p>An “Overall Sentiment” section can depict your user’s mood. You can describe these using text or visuals, including emojis and colors and descriptions to show how their feelings transform over the course of their journey. Additionally, a “Think & Feel” section is where you can write out quotes that represent how your users feel during each phase. </p> <p>To complete this part of the map, go back to the research you did earlier. Through user interviews and social listening, you should have some helpful soundbytes. Familiarize yourself with your users’ language so you can craft feelings that sound just like them. </p> <h3>08. Anticipate problems along the journey</h3> <p>No website is flawless. Even leading brands that have been online for decades must consistently work on refining the user experience. Knowing this, add a “problems” section to your user journey map.</p> <p>This section helps you anticipate where your users may encounter friction, so you can solve these issues in the future. In some cases, it could relate to your web design. For instance, a lengthy checkout form might lead users to abandon your site. In other cases, the problem could be something larger—like a lack of brand reputation. </p> <p>Writing the problems that may keep users from moving to the next step, will help you critically consider and solve how to design your website around them.</p> <h3>09. Think about opportunities for optimization</h3> <p>The “Opportunities” part of a user journey map is where you’ll hypothesize ways to optimize the user experience. Treat this section like a brain dump for all the things you can do to improve the user journey. </p> <p>Once you’ve got a list of ideas, you can look around for case studies and research to back up your hypotheses. Tap into what’s worked for others and load up your “Opportunities” section with data-backed ideas to improve your own users’ journey.</p> <h3>10. Collect data, review and revamp your journey maps</h3> <p>Your initial research helped you get to know your users and how you can optimize your site for them.

From getting found online to starting a newsletter following, a well-designed podcast website can act as a one-stop shop to promote your show. And whether you’re looking to <a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank" >create a website</a> for your podcast or updating a current one, you’ll want to look at these successful podcast website examples for inspiration. </p> <p>This article will dive into our 13 favorite podcast website examples, all built on Wix using <a href="https://www.wix.com/website/templates/html/blog/podcast" target="_blank" >podcast website templates</a>. You’ll find which website template best fits your podcast needs.</p> <h2>Why create a podcast website?</h2> <p>After you’ve <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/10/how-to-start-a-podcast/" target="_blank" >started a podcast</a>, you’ll want to build a podcast website for promotional efforts and strategically design it to amass traffic. While listeners may tune into a podcast for the first time via Apple Podcasts or Spotify, they can't engage with the hosts on these platforms. A podcast website lets you speak directly to your audience and helps you build an authentic brand following with them. </p> <p>Some key benefits to creating a podcast website include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Streamlining your marketing:</strong> If you run a YouTube channel with video podcasts or turn episodes into summary blog posts, your podcast website can house these different <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/12/marketing-strategies/" target="_blank" >marketing strategies</a>. </li> <li><strong>Getting web traffic:</strong> <a href="https://videos.brightedge.com/research-report/BrightEdge_ChannelReport2019_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" >68% of online experiences</a> begin with a search engine and marketers <a href="http://www.edisonresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Edison-Research-Podcast-Consumer-2019.pdf" target="_blank" >Edison Research</a> found that 73% of U.S. podcast consumers discover podcasts through internet searches. Optimize your website with search engine keywords tied to specific <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/03/podcast-topics/" target="_blank" >podcast topics</a> to help drive more traffic to your site. </li> <li><strong>Monetizing your podcast:</strong> If you want to make money with your podcast, a website will help you achieve that goal. While in-stream podcast advertising can drive steady revenue, your website can expand your options. For example, add a donation or subscription page to your website, offer premium and exclusive downloadable resources, or sell merchandise, coaching sessions or paid online courses. </li> <li><strong>Engaging your audience:</strong> Create feedback loops with submission forms for episode ideas to nurture your target listeners and build community. You can also start a newsletter for episode release notifications. </li> </ul> <h2>Best podcast website examples</h2><h3>01.

But you may still wonder what exactly is a blog? How does it differ from a website? Why does every business seem to have one? You may even ask yourself, how can I start my own blog?</p> <p>In short, many individuals and businesses<a href="https://www.wix.com/start/blog" target="_blank" > create a blog</a> to share their ideas and expertise as well as boost their online presence. This article will answer your most pressing blogging questions and help you understand how and why blogs succeed, plus show how you can utilize them.</p> <h3>What is a blog?</h3> <p><strong>Definition of a blog</strong></p> <p>Blogs are regularly updated websites that provide insight into a certain topic. The word blog is a combined version of the words “web” and “log.” At their inception, blogs were simply an online diary where people could keep a log about their daily lives on the web. They have since morphed into an essential forum for individuals and businesses alike to share information and updates. In fact, many people even<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2020/12/how-to-make-money-blogging" target="_blank" > make money blogging</a> as professional full-time bloggers.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_5995423794034ffb9e898152c2f8c9e5~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_528,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Source: Oxford Languages" alt="What is a blog definition"></figure> <p><strong>Types of blogs</strong></p> <p>Different<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/02/types-of-blogs/" target="_blank" > types of blogs</a> cover varying topics, from food and fashion to marketing. Blogs are composed of individual posts on more specific subjects within the blog’s field of expertise. These posts often serve as a platform for discussions, as many blogs have active comments sections. You can think of a blog almost as a newspaper that adds articles and continually maintains the archive. </p> <p>Whether you’ve seen stand-alone blogs or blogs as website sections, you’ve probably encountered<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2018/08/blog-examples/" target="_blank" > blog examples</a> all over the internet. Some of the most popular types of blogs in the <a href="https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/blogosphere" target="_blank" >blogosphere</a> include:</p> <ul> <li>Food blogs</li> <li>Travel blogs</li> <li>Health and fitness blogs</li> <li>Lifestyle blogs</li> <li>Fashion and beauty blogs</li> <li>Parenting blogs</li> <li>Business blogs</li> <li>Sports blogs</li> <li>Art and design blogs</li> </ul> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEI2w0pAlXo&t=1s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEI2w0pAlXo&t=1s</a><p><em><strong>Want to learn more about blogging? Visit</strong></em><a href="https://www.wix.com/learn" target="_blank" ><em><strong> Wix Learn</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> <h3>Website vs blog</h3> <p>As you now know, a blog often deals with a given topic and is updated with regular posts, mostly in the form of articles. Websites, however, are often broken down into inner explanatory pages, each with varying purposes. This can mean anything from an FAQ page to a welcoming homepage design. These pages are occasionally updated, making a website more static than a blog. Oftentimes websites have internal blogs, while other websites are entirely blogs without any additional pages. </p> <p>When blogs are a section of a larger website, the website provides the bulk of the information and uses a blog feature to keep users updated and engaged. For example, think of an<a href="https://www.wix.com/ecommerce/online-store" target="_blank" > online store</a> that also offers a blog about their various products and how to use them.</p> <p>Blogs that make up the entire website usually rely on the content itself rather than sell a product or market a service. </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_870245bb778541bc87c720ffae61740d~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_528,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Fashion blog template" alt="Fashion blog example"></figure><h3>Importance of blogs</h3> <p>Whether it’s personal or professional, a blog provides endless opportunities for a website’s traffic growth. Not to mention, the popularity of blogs hasn't diminished. In fact, the opposite is true: As Neal Shaffer, founder of the digital marketing consultancy PDCA Social says, <a href="https://nealschaffer.com/is-blogging-dead/" target="_blank" >blogging isn’t dead</a>, “blogs are useful for a lot more than just sharing your thoughts. In fact, 60% of consumers will buy something after they’ve read a blog post on the topic.”</p> <p>Blogging is still important today for the following reasons:</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Relationship and community building</strong></p> <p>Much like social media platforms, blogs allow people to share their thoughts and experiences with others. Given the active comment sections, they enable people to interact with one another and build relationships based on shared interests that aren’t limited by geographic location. Essentially, blogs have become a social platform unto themselves.</p> <p><strong>Monetization</strong></p> <p>Another reason why blogging has become so popular is that many people have started<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2019/01/how-to-monetize-blog/" target="_blank" > monetizing their blogs</a>. Bloggers tend to make money off of advertisements in a couple of different forms. One of the most common types of advertisements is<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2020/06/what-is-affiliate-marketing/" target="_blank" > affiliate marketing</a>. Since bloggers often discuss a given topic and experience in their field, they are reliable sources for those topics.</p> <p>For example, if you've<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/05/how-to-start-a-travel-blog/" target="_blank" > started a travel blog</a> and write about your experiences and what you did in various destinations, your readers might follow your advice. Because you provide information about travel attractions and promote them to your readers, those travel attractions might be willing to pay you to increase their visitor count. Bloggers could also make money on digital ads or sell their blogs to larger media entities.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Easy to create</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>On a technical note, blogs have surged because it has become easy for individuals to create and update their own blogs regularly using a code-less website building platform. And because blogs are about any topic of choice, anyone can choose to create their own.</p> <p><strong>Ready to create your own? Get started with these totally customizable </strong><a href="https://www.wix.com/website/templates/html/blog" target="_blank" ><strong>blog website templates</strong></a><a href="https://www.wix.com/website/templates/html/blog" target="_blank" ><strong>.</strong></a> </p><h3> </h3> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_c690e4f5eec4402587f4819ee6132a10~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_528,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Music podcast blog template" alt="Music podcast blog template"></figure><h3>Blogging for business, why is matters</h3> <p>Here are three ways<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/03/blogging-for-business/" target="_blank" > blogging for business</a> can help you promote your business:</p> <p><strong>Keep customers up-to-date</strong></p> <p>Most businesses have turned to blogging to effectively keep customers or clients up-to-date. Since blogs are updated regularly, they enable businesses to share company changes, inform users about deals and provide the best tips possible for using their product.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Inbound marketing opportunities</strong></p> <p>Blogs also allow businesses to provide a wider breadth of content, thereby helping them attract a larger audience of readers. This tactic is called inbound marketing, and is the act of creating content to draw your audience to your brand.</p> <p>Let’s say you sell flowers and your site offers various bouquets. Logically, anyone looking to buy flowers can find what they need on your site. But, if you come up with relevant<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2017/10/content-ideas-for-blogs-and-websites/" target="_blank" > blog content ideas</a> with posts like, “How to Care for Your Flowers” then people who aren’t explicitly looking to buy flowers, but searching for similar keywords, could reach your site. You drive traffic to your site as a result. </p> <p><strong>SEO</strong></p> <p>SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is the practice of improving a website’s position on search engine results, thus improving its visibility. When search engines like Google notice that more people visit a given site, they may consider their content more relevant. In turn, search engines might increase exposure of that website, allowing it to appear closer to the top of the results page. And, of course, the closer to the top of the results a site gets, the more likely people will click on it.</p> <p>Additionally, search engines often look for fresh and timely content. While many websites have relatively static content, a regularly-updated blog provides the perfect forum for content changes. While SEO can feel a bit intimidating, these<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2018/04/seo-for-bloggers/" target="_blank" > SEO for bloggers</a> tips can help ease the process.</p> <p> </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_fb87ab5234cd4c32bf7dac8a4763a14b~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_528,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="Google search results for how to make a chocolate cake"></figure><h3>Why start a professional blog?</h3> <p>A blog is an excellent way to establish your professional expertise in a given field. When you include practical information and regularly updated guides, you present yourself as an authority in your line of work and a leader in your field. </p> <p>Blogging as an expert can also open the door for potential monetization and turning your blog into a career.</p><h3> </h3> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_fb2fa09443e4478abeadc2cfeb574f69~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_528,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Professional food blog template" alt="Snappily professional food blog example"></figure> <h3>Why start a personal blog?</h3> <p>Blogs allow individuals to share updates with friends and family. For example, if you're traveling somewhere exotic and want to share photos and info about your trip with a number of different people, you can direct them to a centralized blog. </p> <p> </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_61e026af190e4d62bd160470a765f83e~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_528,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Personal blog template" alt="Personal blog template"></figure><h3>How to start a blog?</h3> <p>Now that you’ve learned all about blog essentials, you’re ready to <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/02/how-to-start-a-blog/" target="_blank" >start a blog</a>. First, head to a<a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank" > website builder</a> and create an account. Then, choose your favorite customizable blog template to fit the style and needs of your<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/09/blog-design/" target="_blank" > blog design</a>. Finally, you add your authentic content, create blog posts and hit publish. </p> <h3>What to include in a blog</h3> <p>Once you’ve created your blog, it’s time to think about your blog posts. When figuring out your content type, think about your target audience. Be sure to produce evergreen copy and regularly update your blog content. </p> <p>Blog posts should be relatively easy to read and understand, but should nonetheless provide a complete summary of the topic at hand. Check out this article for a complete explanation of<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2019/11/how-to-write-a-blog-post-with-examples/" target="_blank" > how to write a blog post</a> and read through our best<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/03/blog-post-templates/" target="_blank" > blog post templates</a> for inspiration.</p> <p>Writing a blog<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2017/11/how-to-write-catchy-blog-titles/" target="_blank" > starts with knowing how to write a catchy blog title</a>. The title is the first thing that readers see before they even reach your blog. Your title will appear on Google, and most potential readers will judge you by those few words alone. Consider what keywords people would search for to get to your blog or blog post. If you need guidance, a<a href="https://www.wix.com/tools/title-generator" target="_blank" > title generator</a> can point you in the right direction.</p> <p>By getting into your readers’ minds, you can optimize your blog and your writing to become a content powerhouse. </p> <h3>How to make your blog succeed?</h3><p> </p> <p>After launching your blog, you can add elements to your blog to please both readers and Google. Those elements range from quick supplements, such as adding quality visuals to your blog posts, to doing intensive keyword research for SEO purposes.

Mental health specialists can offer virtual counseling to clients who live hours away and artists can ship their work all around the globe. While these opportunities are significant, don’t discount the opportunities that lie right outside your door.</p> <p>Small businesses make up the fabric of their local communities. The national and international franchises certainly have their place, but they don’t offer the same intimacy, comfort or connection that a mom-and-pop hardware store or an independent café provide. Therefore, a local marketing campaign around how your business fits into your community (or how your community influences your business) can have incredible potential. </p> <p>In this article, we’ll define local marketing, discuss its importance and offer some <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/12/marketing-strategies/" target="_blank" >marketing strategies</a> to consider when building your plan. </p> <p><strong>Whether your marketing campaign is local, global or both, make sure to </strong><a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank" ><strong>create a website</strong></a><strong> where people can learn more about and buy from your business.</strong></p> <h2>What is local marketing?</h2> <p>Local marketing is the practice of tailoring a business’s branding and advertising to target consumers who live or spend time in their operating region. This <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/06/types-of-marketing/'" target="_blank" >type of marketing</a> is most popular among small businesses with a single location, such as restaurants and stores. </p> <p>That said, any sort of business can use this tactic—even those without brick-and-mortar. For example, business owners who need to travel to offer their services—such as cleaners, tutors, personal trainers and makeup artists—will find it particularly helpful. </p> <p>Even if your business is fully online, you can still use local marketing. Building your business’s place of origin into its brand can make it more tangible to all your customers, regardless of whether they are local or not.</p> <h2>Why is local marketing important?</h2> <p>When you use local marketing to target customers that live or spend time in your business’s surrounding area, you increase your chances of attracting loyal customers. These clients can work visits to your business into their routines and your business’s physical presence will act as a reminder of its existence if they don’t.</p> <p>According to Uberall’s 2021 study of 4,000 consumers, 74% prefer to <a href="https://get.uberall.com/state-of-local-marketing-report/" target="_blank" >visit a brick-and-mortar location</a> at some point in their shopping journey, whether it’s to process a return or see a product in-person. Tailoring your marketing to reach people who can easily visit your business creates that opportunity.</p> <p>It’s also easier to reach customers through local marketing than through a wider marketing strategy because you know the community. You are familiar with—and likely share—the local consumer’s specific needs, interests and feelings. Plus, emphasizing your identity as a local committed to contributing to the local economy can help to build trust.</p> <p>But local businesses aren’t the only ones that can benefit from local marketing. We’ve seen over and over how brands can stay connected to their places of origin, even as they grow far beyond it. Consider Ben & Jerry’s. Despite having grown into an international brand, it has stayed true to its roots. “Vermont’s Finest” has been their tagline since the very beginning.</p> <p>Finally, local marketing is important because it usually requires lower upfront costs than a campaign that casts a wider net.</p> <h2>9 strategies for building a local marketing campaign</h2> <p>A smart local marketing campaign involves both <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2020/08/what-is-digital-marketing/" target="_blank" >digital marketing</a> and traditional marketing. Let’s discuss a few local marketing strategies you can incorporate into your campaign:</p> <h3>01. Build a review collection plan</h3> <p>According to a 2020 survey, 88% of consumers factor in <a href="https://view.highspot.com/viewer/5fa9e849659e9341abf17968" target="_blank" >reviews</a> when searching for and assessing local businesses. So build a review collection plan into your local marketing strategy. This plan should outline where, how and when you'll respond to guest feedback. Pay special attention to <a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/7091?hl=en#zippy=%2Crelevance%2Cdistance%2Cprominence" target="_blank" >your Google reviews</a> because your “Google review count and review score factor into local search ranking.” </p> <p>Speedy replies enhance your brand reputation and can lead to guests editing their feedback to reflect your response. "If you can respond to a 1- or 2-star review within 24 hours, you have a 33% higher probability of that person coming back and upgrading that review,” Darnell Holloway, Yelp’s director of business outreach, told <a href="https://www.nrn.com/operations/how-turn-bad-review-around" target="_blank" >Nation’s Restaurant News</a>. “So, it's really important from a systemic perspective to consistently respond to those reviews in 24 hours."</p> <h3>02. Work with local influencers</h3> <p>Local influencers have followings specific to the region, so partnering with them ensures that you’ll get the right attention from your target audience. A data survey of 2 million influencers shows that <a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/micro-influencers/" target="_blank" >micro-influencers</a> (those with a following between 10,000 and 100,000 followers) get two to five times as much engagement as influencers with over 100,000 followers. Micro-influencer partnerships can cost less than those with higher follower counts, too. </p> <p>For example, NYC–based <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@eungaro?lang=en" target="_blank" >Emma Ungaro</a> uses her TikTok to show off her luxury fashion budget finds. Despite having fewer than 90,000 followers, eBay paid her to promote its new Luxury Exchange store opening in Manhattan. Her posts didn’t get thousands of likes, but the goal wasn’t to get viral attention; it was just to get New Yorkers in the know about the new venture.</p> <h3>03. Create and optimize your Google Business Profile</h3> <p>When building a local marketing strategy, look to Google’s handy business tools. Google Maps has all but replaced the yellow pages. According to Google, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/maps-platform/9-things-know-about-googles-maps-data-beyond-map" target="_blank" >over a billion people</a> use the platform every month. That means if you don’t have a <a href="https://www.google.com/business/" target="_blank" >Google Business Profile</a> (formerly known as Google My Business), you could be missing out on millions of views.</p> <p>Creating a Google Business Profile enables you to appear on Google Maps, optimize your business for search results and make it easy for locals to find your business and reach out. This will benefit your business because, according to the Uberall survey we mentioned earlier, 77% of consumers use Google to find local business information.</p> <p>Uberall also analyzed year-over-year Google Business Profile metrics and found that most local searches are “non-specific,” meaning consumers look for options rather than a particular business location. For example, if someone wanted to grab a burger, they are more likely to search “burgers near me” over “Wendy’s near me.” </p> <p>Because customers are looking for options, you have a wealth of opportunities to get your business in front of consumers eager to convert. To maximize those opportunities, get your business profile in tip-top shape with a compelling description, high-quality photography and up-to-date business information.</p> <h3>04. Join your local chamber of commerce</h3> <p>A <a href="https://secure.acce.org/pages/chambers/" target="_blank" >chamber of commerce</a> is a collective of businesses working together to further their interests and their community’s economic interests. Joining a local chamber of commerce offers the opportunity to network and make your business more visible in the community. For example, chambers of commerce usually link to their members’ business websites in their online directories.</p> <h3>05. Hone your advertising campaign</h3> <p>Tailor your digital and print advertising to attract locals with these ideas:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Google Ads</strong>: <a href="https://ads.google.com/lp/getstarted/?subid=us-en-ha-awa-bk-c-000!o3~Cj0KCQiA-JacBhC0ARIsAIxybyPv4s0XVVVlCnT5phWzDcvqf2G_RGB8fed9F5sJGEIWbrs8nLbb6x0aAmRaEALw_wcB~137408560317~kwd-94527731~17414652933~614317010567&#38;gclid=Cj0KCQiA-JacBhC0ARIsAIxybyPv4s0XVVVlCnT5phWzDcvqf2G_RGB8fed9F5sJGEIWbrs8nLbb6x0aAmRaEALw_wcB&#38;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" >Google Ads</a> offers the option to set up <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9118422" target="_blank" >local campaigns</a> to boost offline sales and <a href="https://ads.google.com/local-services-ads/#!/" target="_blank" >Local Services Ads</a> for service businesses. Because the latter only needs your business type and location to know if your business is relevant to the local search, it involves less intensive keyword optimization. </li> <li><strong>Print advertising</strong>: Because most consumers <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/print-ads-in-newspapers-and-magazines-are-the-most-trusted-advertising-channel-when-consumers-are-making-a-purchase-decision-300424912.html" target="_blank" >trust advertisements in magazines and newspapers</a> more than all other types of advertising, don’t underestimate setting up strategic ads in local publications.</li> </ul><ul> <li><strong>Review sites</strong>: Most review sites such as <a href="https://business.yelp.com/products/yelp-ads/" target="_blank" >Yelp</a> allow you to create location-targeting ads.</li> </ul><ul> <li><strong>Direct mail</strong>: Snail mail advertisements surprisingly still work. According to one direct mail printer and distributor, their customers receive <a href="https://www.jet-mail.com/blog/does-direct-mail-marketing-still-work-in-2021" target="_blank" >response rates as high as 30%</a>. A direct mail campaign can emphasize the convenience of visiting your establishment for the recipient. </li> </ul> <h3>06. Partner with local businesses</h3> <p>Last year, <a href="https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/marketing/why-dominos-gave-out-gift-cards-local-restaurants" target="_blank" >Domino’s ran a campaign</a> in which they purchased thousands of $50 gift cards from local restaurants and included them in customer deliveries. The campaign successfully demonstrated that Domino’s cares about its local communities, drew attention to how third-party delivery services negatively impact restaurants and shared the spotlight with small businesses. </p> <p>Small business owners could do something similar with cross-promotion, which is the act of using one product or service to support another. Say you run an acupuncture clinic and are looking for new clients—you could reach out to a nearby spa and offer to give their coupons to your customers if they do the same for you. Because you likely share the same customer base but don’t directly compete, you both win.</p> <h3>07. Incorporate outdoor advertising</h3> <p>Although billboards are the most common outdoor advertising, you can use many other cost-effective tactics for local marketing. In addition to pinning fliers to community bulletin boards or setting up chalkboard signs on the walkway in front of your business, you might also consider branding your company vehicle with your company website or QR code so that every drive around town advertises your business.</p> <p>You can also use <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2018/10/guerilla-marketing-examples/" target="_blank" >guerilla marketing</a>, which refers to unconventional advertisements such as murals, graffiti, stickers and projections. This type of advertising has become more popular because it is cheap, memorable and buzz-worthy. For example, the <em>It</em> movie marketing team simply tied the clown’s infamous red balloon to sewer grates and stenciled the copy next to them.</p> <h3>08. Host events</h3> <p><a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/01/event-marketing/" target="_blank" >Event marketing</a> can build brand awareness, generate new leads and incentivize visits to your business website. You can allow other local businesses to set up pop-ups that complement your business model, fundraisers that raise money for relevant causes or information sessions. As a bonus, you can use events to create great content marketing by recording and posting the highlights online. If you don’t have the time, space or capabilities to host your own event, look for local events that you can participate in.</p> <h3>09. Optimize every interaction for customer retention</h3> <p>If you have a brick-and-mortar location, you can retain in-store customers by pointing them towards your website, social media accounts or loyalty program. If you operate primarily online, try similar tactics at the end of customer interactions that emphasize your local small business status. Here are a few low-cost, low-effort and high-reward marketing ideas:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Window displays</strong>: Draw attention with eye-catching window displays or signs displaying great deals. Post a QR code that leads to your site for interested consumers who don’t have time to browse.</li> </ul><ul> <li><strong>Custom receipts</strong>: Customize your print receipts to include your site URL or a QR code that directs them to the homepage. If you offer digital receipts, include a link to your loyalty program sign-up page.</li> </ul><ul> <li><strong>Branded packaging</strong>: According to a marketing research poll, 72 percent of Americans recognize that <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/Most-Americans-Say-That-the-Design-of-a-Products-Packaging-Often-Influences-Their-Purchase-Decisions" target="_blank" >package design</a> influences what they choose to spend their money on. Giving your packaging a cool design (perhaps one that ignites their local pride) will cement your business in the minds of your existing customers and attract the attention of newcomers. Make sure to attach, stamp or print your website domain and social media accounts on the packaging.</li> </ul><ul> <li><strong>Staff ambassadors</strong>: Encourage your staff to mention your <a href="https://www.wix.com/ecommerce/online-store" target="_blank" >online store</a> or loyalty program to customers after completing a sale.</li> </ul> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_2a0d09728dba463da9d4f62042fa084a~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_60,h_60,al_c,q_80/file.png" ></figure><p><strong>By Emily Shwake</strong></p> <p>Wix Blog Writer</p> ]]>

That said, Twitch is no Instagram or Twitter. While some brands may find it incredibly valuable and lucrative to leverage Twitch as a means of building brand awareness and generating leads, others won’t.</p> <p>In this post, we’ll learn the platform’s ins and outs—plus how Twitch works for business and whether or not it fits your brand.</p> <p><strong>Starting a business with Twitch? Make sure to </strong><a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank" ><strong>create a website</strong></a><strong> for your brand and direct Twitch audiences back to your owned-and-operated channel. </strong></p> <h2>What is Twitch?</h2> <p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/" target="_blank" >Twitch</a> is an Amazon-owned, live video-streaming platform. While the most popular content created on Twitch falls into the video game category, creators stream out other genres of content as well.</p> <p>The main categories of content include: </p><ul> <li>Games</li> <li>IRL (In Real Life)</li> <li>Music</li> <li>Esports</li> <li>Creative</li> </ul> <p>However, individuals and brands alike can live stream content related to topics like music, web design, product unboxing, DIY, animals and fitness.</p> <h2>How does Twitch work?</h2> <p>The Twitch.tv platform works as follows:</p> <h3>Account page</h3> <p>Twitch streamers create branded account pages. At the very top of the page, users can see if the streamer is currently online or offline. While offline, the streamer can choose to embed a recent stream for users.</p> <p>For example, the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/netflix" target="_blank" >Netflix Twitch account page</a> looks like this: </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c7b0f0_87c143f4873a40e99b11ec2681de9878~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png" ></figure> <p>Users can peruse information about the streamer, view recent broadcasts, watch select videos and look at the upcoming streaming schedule. </p> <p>They can also follow the streamer from this page. Some channels also allow followers to subscribe for a fee. In return, the subscriber gets special benefits such as ad-free streams, exclusive chats and special badges.</p> <h3>Live broadcast</h3> <p>Twitch creators can stream videos that last anywhere from one minute to eight hours. </p> <p>When streamers go live, the video broadcast takes up the majority of the user’s screen. For example, a broadcast from <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thestockguy" target="_blank" >TheStockGuy</a> looks like this:</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c7b0f0_46153abf4bfa48669ae6bba1848af05f~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_929,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="What is Twitch? Example of TheStockGuy's Twitch page"></figure> <p>In many of these broadcasts, the streamer appears in a small box in the video’s corner so that users can watch them as they talk. This format is common in gaming and other visual-forward content. </p> <p>Other broadcasts look more like YouTube or Instagram’s video streams. Here’s a good example from the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/tominboston" target="_blank" >tominboston</a> account:</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c7b0f0_c94877f979ff4303aa73005cfefc0207~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_929,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="What is Twitch? tominboston's account page "></figure> <p>If users want to focus on the broadcast, they can minimize the two sidebars. The one on the left shows recommended streamers and the one on the right contains the stream’s chat.</p> <h3>Chat box</h3> <p>Like other live streaming services, Twitch creators can engage with anyone watching their live streams via the chat box. Users can also interact with other users—replying to and sending emoticons. </p> <p>However, Twitch allows streamers to enable and create custom Emotes (i.e. emoji) for their audience. You can catch a glimpse of one of these Emotes in the chat box beside <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/maya" target="_blank" >Maya’s live stream</a>:</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c7b0f0_03f0af87b509420099a1bb9a385c30a0~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_929,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="What is Twitch? Maya's live stream example"></figure> <p>When you click on an Emote a user shares, more details appear about the Emote:</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c7b0f0_5d78994cac2f40d7ad9bed17d9b1e207~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_929,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="What is Twitch? Maya's emote example"></figure> <p>You can see that these Emotes are unique to Maya’s channel and that only Tier 1 subscribers can access it. Calls-to-action for following and subscribing appear as well. </p> <h2>Who uses Twitch?</h2> <p>Back in 2018, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/twitch-is-bigger-than-cnn-msnbc-2018-2" target="_blank" ><em>Business Insider</em></a><em> </em>reported that, on average, about 1 million people tune into Twitch at any given moment. That put Twitch on the same level as major cable platforms like Fox News, ESPN and MSNBC.</p> <p>According to <a href="https://twitchadvertising.tv/audience/" target="_blank" >Twitch Sales</a> in 2022, roughly 2.5 million concurrent viewers and about 31 million pass through the platform every day. </p> <p>This is likely because Twitch streams to many devices, including:</p> <ul> <li>Desktop computers</li> <li>Laptops</li> <li>Tablets</li> <li>Smartphones</li> <li>Streaming devices (like Roku and the Fire stick)</li> <li>Smart TVs</li> <li>Game consoles</li> </ul> <p>According to <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/statistics" target="_blank" >TwitchTracker</a>, Twitch users have watched 841 billion minutes of streams in the first eight months of 2022.</p> <p>In terms of Twitch users, the audience breakdown looks like:</p> <ul> <li>75% of Twitch users are between 16 and 34.</li> <li>65% of users are <a href="https://blog.gwi.com/chart-of-the-week/the-rise-of-twitch/" target="_blank" >male</a>.</li> <li>Users stream Twitch content in 35 languages.</li> <li>English is the most commonly spoken language. Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, and Korean are other popular languages.</li> </ul> <p>In sum, Twitch tends to attract a young, multicultural and heavily male audience that use the platform for building and engaging in community.</p> <h2>How to use Twitch for business</h2> <p>The massive number of highly-engaged number users make Twitch one of the <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/12/marketing-strategies/" target="_blank" >best marketing strategies</a> for businesses. Twitch Sales reports that its users have a special relationship with advertising:</p> <ul> <li>They believe that ads enable streamers to continue creating free content.</li> <li>They tend to buy from brands they’ve seen advertised on Twitch.</li> <li>They’ll buy products or services to feel a greater connection with a community.</li> </ul> <p>If you can use Twitch for your brand, you’ll market to an audience that’s receptive to marketing and advertising. In return, you’ll boost brand awareness, enhance your lead generation efforts and increase sales. </p> <p>Businesses use Twitch in three ways: </p> <h3>01. Become a streamer</h3> <p>Brands, both large and small, have their own streaming channels on Twitch that lead back to their website via captions. <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamestop/" target="_blank" >GameStop</a>, for instance, streams a video every Friday from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.:</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c7b0f0_db7669bb59954ade8f7a35a80182ea50~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_929,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="What is Twitch? GameStop streaming example"></figure> <p>GameStop has extended its in-store brand experience online. Some videos give previews and highlights from video games while others show content like unpacking videos or how to build a custom PC gaming system.</p> <p>Smaller brands and entrepreneurs become Twitch streamers, too. For example, Jeff, a personal trainer, runs the <a href="http://fitforpurpose-twitch-account/" target="_blank" >FitForPurpose</a> account:</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c7b0f0_fd2fee3f098f4381bcf5b4efe67d7f6c~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_929,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="What is Twitch? Fitforpurpose's account page"></figure> <p>Monday through Thursday, Jeff livestreams new videos on the channel. His goal isn’t to push his personal training services on anyone but to instruct and inspire his community. </p> <p>To succeed as a streamer, you must have something valuable, entertaining or educational to share with your audience—and not ask for anything in return. </p> <h3>02. Run ads</h3> <p>Streaming isn’t a viable marketing option for many brands. Creating content, engaging with the audience in real time and building a community around a channel can prove to be too time-consuming.</p> <p>If streaming isn’t for you, you can boost your brand’s presence through paid media. Similar to YouTube’s advertising model, you can run video or display ads on Twitch. Both Twitch creators and their followers understand the necessity of mid-stream ads—especially when the content is free. </p> <p>With all parties receptive to advertising, consider this avenue if you have the money for it. Twitch doesn’t actively publish its ad rates on the site, but there is a contact form that asks for your budget. The smallest budget range is Less than $50,000. The highest budget range is Greater than $1,000,000. </p> <p>This high cost can explain why companies like McDonald’s can afford to run ads on top Twitch channels like <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/valorant" target="_blank" >VALORANT</a>’s:</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c7b0f0_a4715cd22740426ca42e335792feaa09~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_929,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="What is Twitch? VALORANT x McDonald's example"></figure> <p>Granted, brands can walk away with huge benefits. VALORANT has over 3 million followers and streams for hours every day. That means huge boosts in brand awareness (and sales) for brands whose ads appear during the broadcast. </p> <h3>03. Partner with streamers</h3> <p>Your last option for using Twitch for business is <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2019/08/what-is-influencer-marketing/" target="_blank" >influencer marketing</a>. By partnering with an established creator or sponsoring their content, you can get your brand in front of a large audience. </p> <p>Depending on how actively the streamer promotes your brand, it could bring you major leads and revenue. That said, a popular streamer doesn’t need to name-drop a brand to influence their followers. A visual brand placement can effectively reach viewers as well. </p> <p>For instance, Monster Energy sponsored a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/cristijan" target="_blank" >cristijAn</a> stream, and placed their logo atop the streamer’s window:</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c7b0f0_064b2f366f29472eaa17c2e96afbfefd~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_929,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="What is Twitch? Monster Energy sponsored stream"></figure> <p>Twitch influencer marketing costs often depends on the following:</p> <ul> <li>What category they create content for</li> <li>How many followers they have</li> <li>How many views their videos get</li> <li>How frequently they will promote your brand</li> <li>What type of partnership or sponsorship they run</li> <li>Whether they want payment, free products or free services in exchange for promotion</li> </ul> <p>Just as with other types of influencer marketing, if you want to get the greatest ROI, your Twitch partner should relate to your brand. For example, CristijAn’s channel centers around gaming; energy drinks are popular with gamers, so the partnership works.</p> <p>Note: <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/426369" target="_blank" ><em>Entrepreneur </em>reported in 2022</a> that Twitch had plans to cut streamer earnings from subscriptions. Estimates put the earnings reduction between 50% and 70%. While streamers who depend on user subscriptions are furious about this decision, this opens up a massive opportunity for brands. </p> <p>For starters, you likely don’t care about subscriber revenue as you’re using Twitch to build brand awareness and gain leads. So if streamers start abandoning the platform, that’ll make room for brands like yours to revolutionize the content that gets noticed there. </p> <p>Also, if streamers don’t make as much money from subscriptions, they might take on more advertisers, partners and sponsors. This could mean partnering with smaller, unknown brands they might not have previously considered.</p> <h2>Is Twitch right for your brand?</h2> <p>When brainstorming <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/06/types-of-marketing/" target="_blank" >types of marketing</a>, you may want to consider if Twitch fits your brand. Consider the following: </p> <h3>01. Is your target audience there?</h3> <p>Twitch tends to skew younger, male and international. If your brand targets a broad range of users, then you might be okay using Twitch. However, if your brand happens to attract older users or operates in a more traditional or conservative space, then you may not find Twitch to be a worthwhile investment. </p> <h3>02. Does your brand fit with Twitch's vibe?</h3> <p>You don’t need to be a gamer or influencer to fit in with the Twitch crowd. All that matters is if you can naturally convey your message in a live video.</p> <p>For instance, have you ever considered starting a vlog or podcast for your brand? Think about how you’ve used video or audio in your business and see if you can translate it for a Twitch audience. </p> <p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/drdrewtv" target="_blank" >Dr. Drew</a>, for instance, has a channel on Twitch where he airs hour-long "Ask Dr. Drew" episodes:</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c7b0f0_530e394c41ec4c6e88f68f24d8fa60b6~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_929,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="What is Twitch? Dr. Drew channel"></figure><h3>03. Will your content be entertaining enough?</h3> <p>Back in 2014, <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2014/08/why-would-anyone-watch-twitch-the-allure-of-the-video-game-streaming-site-explained.html" target="_blank" ><em>Slate</em> contributor Seth Stevenson</a> asked why anyone would want to watch others play video games on Twitch. After spending some time watching various streams on the platform, Stevenson came to an interesting conclusion:</p> <blockquote>“What about those low-key channels where it’s just one dude gaming, and shooting the breeze with his thousands of viewers? Well, those viewers are finding a community of like-minded souls, they’re engaging over a shared interest, and they’re getting tips from superior gamers on how to win at the games. How is this different from watching a cooking show that mesmerizes you while also teaching you how to make a soufflé? Or, for heaven’s sake, watching a show about remodeling nondescript houses in suburban neighborhoods?”</blockquote> <p>Unlike reality TV programming or YouTube channels, Twitch allows users to engage with creators and other users in real time over their shared interests. Does your brand (or even just you as the face of the company) have something entertaining or edifying to share? </p> <p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thecrossfitgames" target="_blank" >TheCrossFitGames</a> is a good example: </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c7b0f0_52dcb09071aa4dc3bec43f757f659619~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_929,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="What is Twitch? CrossFitGames example"></figure> <p>CrossFit, in general, is known for its community. It can also produce content around its Games for others to watch and enjoy. </p> <h3>04. Do you have the time to devote to it?</h3> <p>If you choose advertising or influencer marketing, you’ll devote minimal time designing Twitch ads or promoting your live stream. However, if you want to create, you must invest a significant amount of time. </p> <p>First, you’ll need to design your channel’s artwork, come up with content for the About page and maybe even customize Emotes for your subscribers. Second, you’ll have to produce your content, create a schedule, promote it on other channels, film the live streams and engage with viewers. </p> <p>Your broadcasts must not only be super engaging, but also well-managed. Planning and organizing has allowed Twitch brands like <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nasa" target="_blank" >NASA</a> to amass over a million followers:</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c7b0f0_87d4ebcd0e7942e78ad376db5aad761b~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_929,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="What is Twitch? NASA's account page"></figure><h3>05. How much money can you realistically invest in Twitch marketing?</h3> <p>Streaming is an affordable venture. By <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/348978" target="_blank" ><em>Entrepreneur</em>’s estimates</a>, it could cost about $100 to buy a bundle of live streaming gear. That includes things like a tripod, an extender and lighting.</p> <p>Advertising, on the other hand, will likely cost your brand thousands of dollars a month. You may cut costs through influencer marketing—especially if you exchange product for exposure—but it’ll still cost your brand money. </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_2a0d09728dba463da9d4f62042fa084a~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_60,h_60,al_c,q_80/file.png" ></figure><p><strong>By Emily Shwake</strong></p> <p>Wix Blog Writer</p> ]]>

According to Josh Brentan, a brand shaper who has named many Wix products and features, iteration is the key to successfully naming a business. He says to do multiple rounds of brainstorming—and only start to narrow down once you have a long list of potential names. To start, use a free<a href="https://www.wix.com/tools/business-name-generator" target="_blank" > business name generator</a> to come up with a list of catchy options that will work for your branding goals. In this article, we’ll go over the best tips on how to go from brainstorming to deciding on a business name, plus how to register yours. </p> <p><strong>Once you nail your name, create a </strong><a href="https://www.wix.com/business/website" target="_blank" ><strong>business website </strong></a><strong>and register your brand name as your domain name.</strong> </p><h2>Why is a business name important?</h2> <p>A good business name can shape how a customer perceives a brand. Therefore, a business name also has practical implications: It can help protect your brand reputation over time. A<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0148296321006925" target="_blank" > 2022 study found</a> that “fun” business names—or those that used creative linguistics like playful fonts, symbols and unique spelling—protected against brand transgression. The researchers showed that “fun brand names create hedonic value for consumers by playing with language and creating brand names in inventive ways.” </p><h2>Types of business names</h2><p><strong> </strong></p> <p>There are many types of business names, each designed to have a specific impact on consumers. Choose yours according to your target audience and brand identity. </p> <p><strong> </strong></p><h3>Descriptive business names</h3> <p>Descriptive business names are utilitarian and specific to the offered product or service. These names leave little room for interpretation and may benefit a business entering a new market. They could also be harder to trademark or register since they contain generic words or phrases. </p> <p>Examples:</p><ul> <li>Bank of America</li> <li>The Weather Channel </li> <li>Hotels.com</li> </ul><p><strong> </strong></p><h3>Abstract business names </h3> <p>Non-descriptive names are interesting, inventive and instantly grab customer attention. They strike a specific tone, whether playful, formal, motivating, optimistic or humorous. </p> <p>Examples: </p><ul> <li>Kodak </li> <li>Venmo</li> <li>Waze </li> </ul><h3>Acronymic business names</h3><p><strong> </strong></p> <p>These short and sweet business names are easy to remember and spell. Science and technology-related companies commonly use acronymic business names. These names do not transfer emotions or creativity to their customers. </p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Examples:</p><ul> <li>HP</li> <li>IBM</li> <li>NASA</li> </ul><p> </p><h3>Geographical business names</h3> <p>Geographical names link the business to its location, making it easier for local customers to identify them or to provide context for those outside of the region. However, these straightforward names can often make it harder for companies to grow outside their locality. </p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Examples:</p><ul> <li>California Pizza Kitchen </li> <li>Brooklyn Brewery </li> <li>American Vintage</li> </ul> <h3>Compound business names</h3> <p>Compound business names combine two different terms to form a new, memorable and often friendly word. They may comprise a descriptive and abstract word, two descriptive terms, etc. </p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Examples: </p><ul> <li>PayPal </li> <li>Netflix </li> <li>FedEx</li> </ul> <h3>Founder business names</h3> <p>If you want to create heritage and legacy for your brand, name your business after its founders. This business name type can also help customers emotionally connect with your brand. Businesses like law and accounting firms commonly use founder business names to evoke professionalism and trust.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Examples: </p><ul> <li>Ben & Jerry’s </li> <li>The Walt Disney Company</li> <li>Johnson & Johnson</li> </ul><h2><strong>How to name a business</strong></h2><p>First study your industry and competitors to know which type of business name is most effective for your market, Then, use the following steps to brainstorm a list of potential business names. </p><ol> <li>Use a business name generator</li> <li>Create a mash-up</li> <li>Appeal to your audience’s interests</li> <li>Pick a scalable business name</li> <li>Consider acronyms</li> <li>Beware of trends</li> <li>Tell your story</li> <li>Make sure it flows</li> <li>Test it with an audience</li> <li>Check that it’s available</li> </ol> <h3><strong>01. Use a business name generator</strong></h3><p><strong> </strong></p> <p>A business name generator can help streamline your brainstorming. To start, write down three simple things: type of business, a catchy word to include in the name, and how you would describe your brand.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>As you come up with descriptive terms, ask yourself what your business name should communicate. Check for terms associated with your product or service. For example, if you launch an online store that sells natural products, consider words like “raw,” “green,” “fresh,” or “organic.”</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Once you type in the words, the tool produces many options. To further narrow down your choices, perform market research and draw inspiration from the <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/08/best-company-names/" target="_blank" >best company names</a> among your competitors. </p><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6542d9_60bac2c86b8b4c718aa31ccae73fa239~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_671,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="how to come up with a business name - business name generator"></figure><h3><strong>02. Create a mash-up</strong></h3> <p>Combining two existing words can result in a fun, distinct and captivating business name. Mash-ups (also called portmanteaus) work surprisingly well for a business name, since they can creatively communicate your company’s greater mission. For example, Groupon combines “group” and “coupons,” and “instant camera” and “telegram” for Instagram.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>To create your own, jot down words associated with your brand. If your business has two or more concepts, use a portmanteau to ensure your name reflects both ideas. Then remove the first word’s last syllables and the second word’s beginning syllables. Write your frankenword on paper and read it. Ask yourself, “Is your newly invented word unsightly, or does it have character?” Consider playing around with spelling for a more polished name, like Netflix (internet and flicks).</p> <h3><strong>03. Appeal to your audience’s interests</strong></h3> <p>An effective name should create buzz around your business and its offerings. While your business’s name doesn’t have to convey an obvious meaning, it should evoke a particular interest, memory or feeling for your audience. Take Whole Foods, for example. Its name suggests health and wellness to its target market yet is broad enough to appeal to all food shoppers.</p> <p>Whole Foods rolled out its private label brand—<a href="https://media.wholefoodsmarket.com/whole-foods-market-introduces-365-by-whole-foods-market-chain" target="_blank" >365</a>, signaling a clear message: customers can expect fresh food and a unique shopping experience every day of the year. Jeff Turnas, senior vice president of global culinary at Whole Foods, said: “For the past 37 years, we have built our company by leading with high quality standards and continuous innovation. We are now excited for the next evolution to extend our offerings to a broader audience in a way that complements our successful Whole Foods Market brand.”</p> <h3><strong>04. Pick a scalable business name</strong></h3><p><strong> </strong></p> <p>As a rising small business owner, you’ll need to plan for your future while getting your business off the ground. Although you can’t predict what your company will look like in the coming years, choose a business name that won’t limit your entrepreneurial growth.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Imagine if the skateboarding shoe company Vans picked a name focusing on footwear alone, like “Sneaks.” It could have prevented the company from becoming a household name for much more, such as clothing, fashion accessories and backpacks.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>In turn, don’t choose a highly specific business name. For instance, the hypothetical Nonna’s Gnocchi small business could easily offer other pastas, thus the word Gnocchi in the name could inhibit business growth. Likewise, names based on a geography may not always work if you expand to other cities, countries and continents.</p> <h3><strong>05. Consider acronyms </strong></h3> <p>Along with keeping it short and simple, consider the acronym that will follow before you select a business name.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>An acronym is a term formed from the first letter of each word in a phrase. The public better recognizes the acronyms of several multi-billion dollar companies than their full name, including IBM (International Business Machines) and CVS (Consumer Value Stores).</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Though you might not want to abbreviate your business name, your customers or other companies might refer to its initials anyway. Properly investigate your acronym’s meaning before going to market to evade an embarrassing result.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6542d9_fce74ca47783454f883a9353670c8fe7~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_653,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="how to come up with a business name"></figure> <h3><strong>06. Beware of trends</strong></h3> <p>Businesses that have successfully evolved over time share one thing: They’ve avoided trends. Take the case of the “drop the vowel” trend and which led to brand names like Flickr, Grindr and Scribd. While it might have seemed hip or cool to do at the time, the names now sound dated and aren’t easy to say, spell or recognize worldwide.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>You also want to consider how your business name will visually appear in your logo, which is key to your brand identity. <a href="https://www.wix.com/logo/maker" target="_blank" >Create your own logo</a> using your business name. </p> <h3><strong>07. Tell your story</strong></h3> <p>Great storytelling evokes certain emotions and creates personal connections. A good business name can do the same for its customers.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Ben & Jerry’s global ice cream takeover exemplifies a perfect brand story. Today, the name celebrates the grassroots success of its founders, who never gave up on their dreams. “With a $5 correspondence course in ice cream-making from Penn State and a $12,000 investment ($4,000 of it borrowed), Ben and Jerry opened their first ice cream scoop shop in a renovated gas station in Burlington, Vermont,” says<a href="https://www.benjerry.com/about-us" target="_blank" > its website</a>. While the company scaled to a larger corporation owned by Unilever, the name Ben & Jerry’s evokes the industrious story of the owners behind it.</p> <h3><strong>08. Make sure it flows</strong></h3> <p>Pay attention to how your business name sounds in conversation, video and audio recordings. Start with speaking it aloud as a test, then progress to using it in sentences and speaking about it with your acquaintances. Does it roll off the tongue? If a person can’t easily pronounce your business name, then they might avoid talking about it altogether.</p> <h3><strong>09. Test it with an audience</strong></h3> <p>Reach out to friends, family, partners and investors to get their insight and validate your business name. These conversations can further inspire you or cause you to rethink your name choice.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>During these conversations, ask questions like <em>What feelings does the name give you?</em> <em>Do you find it easy or difficult to spell</em>? Guide their attention to these aspects to receive more constructive feedback.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>If you catch yourself explaining a long and complex story about your name, consider this a sign to go back to the drawing board. You want your business’s name to be on the tip of everyone’s tongue, so it should be snappy, memorable and stand on its own.</p> <h3><strong>10. Check that it’s available</strong></h3> <p>Make sure that you can own your chosen business name and that another company doesn’t already use it. This will come in handy when you<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/06/how-to-register-business-name/" target="_blank" > register a business name</a>. To do so, check out the following places:</p><ul> <li><strong>The</strong><a href="https://www.wix.com/domain/domain-name-search" target="_blank" ><strong> </strong></a><strong>domain availability:</strong> As a business owner, you must maintain an online presence. When you create a website, your domain name should be closely associated with your business name. Check that this domain hasn’t already been taken using a <a href="https://www.wix.com/domain/domain-name-search" target="_blank" >domain name search</a> tool. </li> <li><strong>Search engines:</strong> See what comes up when you search your name. If you do business internationally, check for cultural references across the countries. </li> <li><strong>Social media platforms: </strong>Search social media to make sure that the name is available. Your Instagram handle, Facebook Business Page, and the other social media branding aspects can be just as important to your business as your domain name. </li> <li><strong>Your local business registration service:</strong> Check that someone else didn’t already register a business name similar to yours. If you live in the U.S., you can check with<a href="https://www.uspto.gov/" target="_blank" > uspto.gov</a>. If you are located elsewhere, go to the host country’s government website and familiarize yourself with their business registration process. </li> <li><strong>Register your business name: </strong>Lastly, if you choose to register your business name, you’ll need to first file legal paperwork for becoming a business entity. You may select to form an <a href="https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/limited-liability-company-llc" target="_blank" >LLC</a>,<a href="https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/c-corporation" target="_blank" > C-corp</a> or <a href="https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/partnership" target="_blank" >partnership</a>. Your entity name will be the legal name for your business and you’ll have to sign every official document under this name as required by state laws. Register your business name with the secretary of state’s office, local or county agencies. </li> </ul><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6542d9_d6065eada5d746719bf5c6a23d826d68~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_465,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="domain name availability"></figure> <p>Let the idea marinate overnight or even for a few weeks. Can you see the name splashed across a billboard or in the news? This will allow you to truly see if it fits. You can always operate as<a href="https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/doing-business-as-DBA" target="_blank" > a DBA</a> (doing business as) before making it official. However, changing your official business name later on—in legal documents and branding assets—might be more complex than doing it right now, especially if you’ve built brand recognition.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>After all is said and done, no matter how you come up with a business name, make sure you’re personally happy with it.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6542d9_14f806dccd7449d9bbde1963800fc40b~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_60,h_60,al_c,q_80/file.png" ></figure><p><strong>By Cecilia Lazzaro Blasbalg</strong></p> <p>Small Business Expert & Professional Writer</p> ]]>

Why? Because you own it. You can use it to control the way visitors interact with your brand and how they purchase your products. What's more, you don’t have to deal with ever-changing social media algorithms.</p> <p>Good website branding encompasses everything from the way you <a href="https://www.wix.com/logo/maker" target="_blank" >make a logo</a> to your website copy and CTAs. In this article, we’ll explore the importance of website branding and how to properly represent your brand online. </p> <h2>What is website branding?</h2> <p>To understand website branding, let’s first look at the concept of branding. <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/05/what-is-branding/" target="_blank" >Branding </a>encompasses all steps a company takes to shape how a customer perceives them. Branding cannot be easily quantified, but its success is rather measured by the emotions felt in the symbiotic relationship between brand and consumer.</p> <p>Branding takes place both on and offline—at every touchstone of your business. It goes beyond your logo, color palette or <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2018/11/catchy-slogan-examples/" target="_blank" >catchy slogan</a> and trickles down into every way your brand interacts with new and existing customers, as well as competitors and stakeholders.</p> <p>With this in mind, website branding extends the visual and non-visual aspects of your <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2018/10/what-is-brand-identity-how-to-create-your-own/" target="_blank" >brand identity</a> into one digital space. </p> <p>Since many potential customers first interact with your brand through your website, you have only a few seconds to make a delightful and meaningful first impression. A good website should clearly communicate <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/04/brand-messaging/" target="_blank" >brand messaging</a> right from the start of the experience. </p> <h2>Why you need a branded website</h2> <p>According to <a href="https://siteefy.com/how-many-websites-are-there/" target="_blank" >Siteefy</a>, around 1.14 billion websites exist in the world, with 175 new websites created every minute (that’s three every second). This noisy and competitive space continues to grow, offering businesses a lucrative opportunity to grab the attention of a global audience.</p> <p>And while you can quickly and easily start a social media profile to support your business and branding efforts, you should simply think of it as a stepping stone to your website. </p> <p>Think about it: Your website is available 24/7 for both new and returning customers who want learn more about your brand or, better yet, convert and generate sales for your business. </p> <p>A well-branded website can:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Establish trust.</strong> Maintaining brand consistency and an overall professional look and feel to your website can help bolster credibility and <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/ecommerce/2020/05/what-is-brand-trust" target="_blank" >brand trust</a>. Familiar branding aspects on a reliably performing company website can instantly set users at ease. </li> <li><strong>Communicate effectively</strong>. Regardless of your industry, a personal or corporate brand connects your business to consumers. Unlike social media, your website grants total control over the look, feel and rules of engagement. This means setting your own website copy, blog posts and even newsletters. On your website, users can subscribe to an email lists, giving you reliable access to their inboxes for further engagement via drip content and lead generation. </li> <li><strong>Build authority</strong>. If you <a href="https://www.wix.com/start/blog" target="_blank" >create a blog</a> for your branded website, you’ll build organic search opportunities to drive traffic and establish your authority and credibility. In addition, you can publish content that establishes your brand as a thought leader for expertise, opinions or even trends. </li> <li><strong>Promote the brand.</strong> Not only does a website showcase your brand’s tone, products and <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/08/visual-identity/" target="_blank" >visual identity</a>, you can also promote other channels on it. For example, you can share webinars, podcasts, e-books or even <a href="https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/co-branding" target="_blank" >co-branding</a> directly on your website. Artists or creatives can also show off their work in a portfolio. </li> <li><strong>Guide decisions</strong>. Let the data tell a story. Website traffic and conversions can measure how many visitors engage in a session on your website. If you notice that users bounce right away and and don't return, you can take this as a sign that something is off on your website. These helpful metrics can give deeper insight into user behavior and interactions with your brand. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> With <a href="https://www.wix.com/manage/analytics" target="_blank" >Wix analytics</a> you can review your site’s traffic, visitor behavior and revenue reports all in one convenient dashboard and make decisions based on the data.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_76cdb4de87574f15b5b2d4fc819bd62c~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_528,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="Nespola Studio website branding, bold tangerine color"></figure><h2>How to create a branded website</h2><ol> <li>Define your brand identity </li> <li>Refine your user experience </li> <li>Establish brand trust </li> <li>Use your brand voice </li> <li>Be aware of user pain points </li> <li>Set up an easy layout and site structure </li> <li>Maintain consistency </li> <li>Keep your branded website up to date </li> </ol><h3>01. Define your brand identity</h3> <p>Your brand identity encapsulates all the visual and non-visual aspects of your business. It is best contained in a <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2020/07/brand-style-guide/" target="_blank" >brand style guide</a>. Some features that you should consider in your website branding include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Visual identity:</strong> This is the <a href="https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/visual-language" target="_blank" >visual language</a> that your brand communicates in one cohesive aesthetic across every touchstone. </li> <li><strong>Logo:</strong> A logo instantly signifies your brand and makes it easy for consumers to recognize you when entering your website. Most site owners place their logo at the top left, as most languages are read left to right. Both brand and UX experts consider this spot an important one. Also include your logo in the website footer, contact page, blogs, favicon and any purchase confirmation page. Depending on your website layout, you may also consider linking your logo to your homepage, so users can easily navigate back in one click. </li> <li><strong>Brand colors:</strong> As part of your brand identity, you should certainly consider your <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2020/01/brand-colors/" target="_blank" >brand colors</a> in your website alongside user experience and readability. For example, if your brand colors are bright yellow and orange, you may want these colors to appear in certain parts of your website, but not necessarily as a font color. Remember that colors can trigger emotional responses and influence how users interact with your website. In fact, nearly <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/how-colors-affect-conversion-rates.pdf" target="_blank" >93%</a> of people say the visual dimension (color) influences their purchase decision over taste, smell, etc. <strong>Tip:</strong> When you <a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank" >create a website</a>, the <a href="https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-customizing-your-color-theme" target="_blank" >Wix Editor customizes your color theme </a>automatically across your site and in all the 'themed” elements in the Add panel. You can also apply your theme colors to any element on your site using your brand colors. Alternatively, you can browse through the ready-made color presets and choose the perfect option for your brand. <strong><em>Fun fact:</em></strong> Most website hyperlinks <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/how-colors-affect-conversion-rates.pdf" target="_blank" >appear in blue</a>, since “red and green are the colors most altered by color-vision deficiency. Almost no one has a blue deficiency.” </li> </ul><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_be49d1a7ec3d475f92787f0c2cb3612e~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_528,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="website brand colors, color picker menu"></figure><p> </p><ul> <li><strong>Typography:</strong> Like other visual mediums, <a href="https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/typography" target="_blank" >typography</a> can effectively communicate more about your brand voice than words itself. In addition, website typography must appear sharp, uncluttered and legible on any size screen. Typography experts recommend to never use more than three fonts on your website. Keep in mind that each of your fonts should carry its own level of importance to establish hierarchy and balance your website text. You can read more about <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2018/01/how-to-choose-best-fonts-website/" target="_blank" >how to choose the best fonts for websites</a> to better understand the impact. </li> </ul><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_28f45e7e26fb4366bbf223b539a6b471~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_528,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="website branding typography options "></figure><ul> <li><strong>Imagery/photography:</strong> Brand imagery affects all visual aspects of your business. Pictures evoke emotion and tell a story at a glance. So when choosing graphics or photographs for your website, keep your brand identity in the forefront. In addition, know your audience and pick visuals that strategically speak to them. You're not limited to photographs on your branded website. You can also include illustrations. In any case, make sure it's a high-quality file appropriately sized for the space it'll will take up on the website. Consider users viewing images on a mobile screen compared to a desktop. For example, if you use a large image in your website’s header, look at how it appears on a phone or tablet. Remember, if you use stock photos, show a diverse range of subjects. </li> <li><strong>Templates</strong>. If you create your branded website with a builder like Wix, you can access a wide range of free customizable templates to streamline your branding efforts across every page. For example, these <a href="https://www.wix.com/website/templates/html/online-store/fashion-clothing" target="_blank" >fashion and clothing templates</a> include an <a href="https://www.wix.com/ecommerce/online-store" target="_blank" >online store</a> with spaces for your company’s logo, story and messaging. </li> </ul> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_0de0aa99e69441f59e4a65259a1a7f94~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_528,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="Best Sellers page for lamp store, showing website templates colors and themes"></figure><h3>02. Refine your mobile experience</h3> <p>Today, mobile internet traffic accounts for almost <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/" target="_blank" >55%</a> of total web traffic. A person's first interaction with your brand likely will take place on their mobile device, which means you must optimize your site accordingly.</p> <p>You can take a few key steps for your website’s branding to better perform on mobile, including:</p> <ul> <li>Optimizing for mobile-first indexing</li> <li>Minimizing or hiding page elements for mobile</li> <li>Using CTAs for effective navigation</li> <li>Adding a “Back to Top” button</li> <li>Hyperlinking your logo to the website’s homepage</li> <li>Using mobile-friendly menus like hamburger menus</li> <li>Integrating mobile features</li> </ul> <p>Anything from mobile animated features to unique scrolling effects shape the brand and mobile user experience. </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_ba0d92539e45414690aab46191906489~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_528,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="website branding on desktop and mobile showing &quot;new collection&quot; for furniture"></figure><h3>03. Establish brand trust</h3> <p>While your branded website serves to establish and foster brand trust, you can further build this concept into your design.</p> <p>First, consider the value and importance of social proof. In fact, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2022/11/10/nine-ways-advertising-could-change-in-2023-according-to-these-entrepreneurs/?sh=460c9116270c" target="_blank" ><em>Forbes</em></a> considers social proof to be one of the nine ways advertising could change in 2023. As Mary Harcourt of CosmoGlo shares, “Social proof will be the new trend for how customers shop in the near future.” Harcourt says,</p> <blockquote>“Social proof is trusted, inevitable and a much more effective way to gain new sales. The psychology is that a consumer feels better about purchasing because a peer has previously purchased the item and had a good experience.”</blockquote> <p>To build social proof, integrate customer reviews and testimonials into your website branding. Reviews can take on many forms including video testimonials, case studies, interviews, press reviews and social posts. Authenticity is key here, so be as transparent as possible. </p> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> The <a href="https://www.wix.com/app-market" target="_blank" >Wix App Market </a>is full of customer review, testimonial and social proof tools that you can easily integrate into your website. </p> <h3>04. Use your brand voice </h3> <p>Your website is the place to let your <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/02/brand-voice/" target="_blank" >brand voice</a> shine. You can get your brand message across using a diverse range of content including:</p> <ul> <li>Website copy (and microcopy like CTAs)</li> <li>Blog posts</li> <li>Email newsletters</li> <li>Chatbots</li> <li>Brand story (‘About us’ section)</li> <li>Downloadable content</li> </ul> <p>Regardless of communication type, your brand voice should always be present and your customers should be able to easily recognize it. For example, the Wix brand voice is approachable, reaching a wide range of audiences and maintaining a friendly tone, almost like two professionals conversing. Wix’s products consistently use this tone, from the <a href="https://www.wix.com/tools/domain-name-generator" target="_blank" >Domain Name Generator</a> to the <a href="https://www.wix.com/seo/learn" target="_blank" >Wix SEO Learning Hub</a> and even social posts.</p> <p>Your branded website’s content should also outline a clear content strategy that extends to external content, including guest articles and brand/influencer collaborations.</p> <h3>05. Be aware to user pain points </h3> <p>Your website branding must ensure an optimal user experience (UX). Using <a href="https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/user-experience-design-uxd" target="_blank" >user experience design (UXD)</a>, you can plan your site to include features that positively impact user satisfaction and, in turn, brand loyalty. </p> <p>If your website's aesthetic, usability and <a href="https://www.wix.com/accessibility" target="_blank" >accessibility</a> cause visitors to have a good experience, they'll likely form positive associations to your brand or business. </p> <p>Ultimately, functionality can make or break your branded website. You must understand your target audience and how they want to interact with your website to optimize functions accordingly. If you recognize an issue, like a certain product hasn't sold as well as another, see that the checkout or the product page function as expected. An FAQ section and available customer support can help customers mitigate a range of issues the moment they experience one.</p> <p>Be equally mindful of all aspects of customer pain points, including those pertaining to finances, productivity and support. Everything from the way you price your merchandise to the time it takes to check-out and receive a product can influence a customer's online experience. </p> <p>To understand the customer experience, you must ask your customers for direct feedback. You can do this through questionnaires, feedback forms, emails and more. You can also look at external review or competitor websites to see what consumers say about your branded website.</p> <h3>06. Set up an easy layout and site structure</h3> <p>To maximize your website branding and offer the best possible experience, stick to an easy layout and site structure. Less is more. </p> <p>Regardless of your industry, your branded website should be clear and easy-to-navigate, plus it should reflect your brand values and purpose.</p> <p>In addition, understanding your user's needs alongside your website's purpose can help you decide your layout. It boils down to knowing what to highlight on your website and where. For example, if you are an artist, you’ll likely want to use bigger imagery that highlights your work. On the other hand, if you are a masseuse, you likely want your customers to focus on your offering, price points, location and testimonials.</p> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Build a branded website with Wix and use <a href="https://www.wix.com/website/templates" target="_blank" >ready-made templates</a> that take these details into account. </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_170f3e200d7d4ee9ad784641e4e84984~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_528,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="Website hierarchy button design options"></figure><h3>07. Maintain consistency</h3> <p>Branding consistency is key. You want customers to have the same experience when walking into a brick-and-mortar store, unboxing a package at home, interacting with a brand ambassador and using your website. </p> <p>What’s more, you can’t control where or how visitors come to your site. One customer may spontaneously come to your site via a social media ad, while another types in your URL from their office desktop. Regardless of external factors, they need to experience the same excellent site performance and functionality.</p> <p>In addition, customers who experience your brand on other channels or platforms want to feel the same feeling when entering your site for the first time. By aligning your website to your brand style guide, you can maintain consistency and ensure customers have the same experience on your site.</p> <h3>08. Keep your website up to date</h3> <p>You’ve put in all the time and effort to build your branded website, but the work doesn't end there. Just as you nurture your brand, you must give the same attention to website maintenance and upkeep. </p> <p>Regular website maintenance includes updating and refreshing content, checking for broken links, ensuring your site performs properly and keeping visuals fresh and aligned with your branding needs.</p> <p>This also includes security updates, uptime monitoring, SEO optimization and general support and maintenance issues. </p> <h2>Website branding examples </h2> <p>Let’s look at some of the best website branding examples that set the bar high.</p> <h3>Koketit</h3> <p>Wix user and Tel Aviv-based artist Shira Barzilay is the face behind the iconic <a href="https://www.koketit.com/" target="_blank" >Koketit</a>. In her own words, “The world is her canvas.” She's made this evident through her distinct artistic style seen in collaboration with brands like Zara, Cartier, Elizabeth Arden, Vogue Portugal, Harper’s Bazaar and Revlon. Most recently, she collaborated with Porsche to hand paint a Taycan.</p> <p>Barzilay reflects her unique, unmistakable style on her website. Images of her artwork front and center on her site do the talking. Users can easily navigate through the site to her online shop, view collaborations or even explore NFTs. Koketit’s branded website also has an ‘Inspiration’ section showing artfully curated walls showcasing her work in homes. Visiting her site is as just an eye-catching and exciting experience as her artwork itself. </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_cbb39832e383491c8a2f74764aff90ef~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_528,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="Koketit and Porsche collaboration on homepage"></figure><h3>La Vie </h3> <p>People know French plant-based bacon brand <a href="https://www.laviefoods.com/en/" target="_blank" >La Vie</a> for their animal-free product line as well as their cheeky attitude. The brand is bright, bold and humorous in both its visual aesthetic and brand messaging. As La Vie explains, “We are building a movement, a positive change for the industry and for the planet.” Website visitors can feel this core value across every element of La Vie’s branding. </p> <p>Their playful website copy includes phrases like, “Bacon and lardons without Mr. Piggy. 100% Veggie” or “Save a pig’s bacon. Eat La Vie,” making the brand's mission clear to any website visitor. The brand’s vibrant color palette of bubble pinks, sky blues and bright yellow appear in splashes throughout the website. Visitors will find the site easy to navigate, plus will walk away understanding the product offering and environmental impact. </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_fc34b6022a2a41358ac110ba02440cf3~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_528,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="La Vie website branding example"></figure><h3>Liquid Death</h3> <p>Cult-favorite water brand <a href="https://liquiddeath.com/" target="_blank" >Liquid Death</a> has been recently dubbed <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/liquid-death-canned-water-gen-z" target="_blank" >Gen Z’s La Croix</a>. In Liquid Death’s own words, “We’re just a funny water company who hates corporate marketing as much as you do. Our evil mission is to make people laugh and get more of them to drink more water more often, all while helping to kill plastic pollution.” And, so far, they’ve succeeded: The water brand is valued at <a href="https://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/22382-liquid-death-valued-at-700-million-in-latest-raise" target="_blank" >$700 million in its latest raise</a> and is the top-selling still water and second top-selling sparkling water on Amazon.</p> <p>Every detail of Liquid Death’s website branding communicates their message and values. Upon entry to the site, a reel of user-generated content (UGC) greets visitors, showing real people of all ages creatively drinking Liquid Death. As visitors continue scrolling, another video shows devil-like characters killing plastic bottles, aptly referred to as "<a href="https://liquiddeath.com/pages/death-to-plastic" target="_blank" >Death to Plastic</a>." The brand even partnered with Martha Stewart to create a life-sized severed hand candle using Liquid Death cans—a creative and eco-friendly effort to battle pollution.</p> <p>The branded website considers every detail, including a skull icon in their favicon, a “Sell your soul” membership club, branded merchandise and more. </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_eb77be50fbdc4263ae2c08f1f411784d~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_528,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="Liquid death website branding"></figure><h3>Weirdoh Birds</h3> <p>Founded by visual artist, photographer and Wix-user Orit Harpaz, <a href="https://www.weirdohbirds.com/" target="_blank" >Weirdoh Birds</a> is a creativity-forward lifestyle brand focused on home goods and hospitality products.

Amid inflation, U.S. businesses hesitating to raise their prices must pay that difference themselves or be forced to transfer some of those costs over to customers, potentially losing loyal clients in the process. </p> <p>Moreover, a <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/citizenship/10000-small-businesses/US/infographics/april2022/index.html" target="_blank" >2022 Goldman Sachs survey</a> found that 91% of small business owners already struggle with the current economy’s impact on their industries, and 56% say the situation has worsened since the beginning of the year, painting a bleaker picture for the coming months. </p> <p>Modern small businesses face multi-layered global challenges extraordinary. Following two years of COVID lockdowns, Russia’s war in Ukraine and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/supply-chain-chaos-is-hitting-global-growth-and-could-get-worse.html" target="_blank" >supply chain chaos</a>, businesses brace for a “menacing” economic storm, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-29/supply-chain-latest-war-in-ukraine-and-china-lockdowns-add-turmoil" target="_blank" >Bloomberg</a> reports. In this article, we will discuss some of the most pressing small business challenges today, look at what <a href="https://www.wix.com/business/website" target="_blank" >small business websites</a> are doing to navigate them, and more:</p> <h2>Small business challenges</h2><h3>01. Understanding broader economic trends </h3> <p>In March 2022, <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220316a.htm" target="_blank" >the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.25%</a>, pushing the federal funds rate to 0.50% and marking the latest interest rate hike since December 2018. <a href="https://www.business.org/finance/accounting/effects-of-inflation-on-small-businesses/" target="_blank" >According to a 2021 Business.org survey</a>, 82% of businesses have already raised the price of their products or services due to inflation. While some businesses modified their inventory to save on costs, buying the minimum amount of items they can store, many business owners have drastically changed their business model to fit into the new economic order. </p> <p>Supply chain disruption has become another challenge for small businesses, with 63% of business owners saying they’ve altered their supply chain in the past six months, as reported by the <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sbindex/" target="_blank" >U.S. Chamber and MetLife Small Business Index</a>. Empty grocery store shelves, insufficient supply of everyday items like refrigerators and delayed packages makes it difficult for them to meet customer demand. </p> <p>To protect their future, small business owners need to recognize the larger forces at play—supply chain issues, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/is-long-covid-worsening-the-labor-shortage/" target="_blank" >labor shortages</a>, inflation and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/03/business/energy-environment/high-electric-bills-summer.html#:~:text=The%20latest%20figures%2C%20from%20February,the%20Energy%20Department's%20latest%20figures." target="_blank" >rising energy costs</a>—and understand what’s driving these economic trends. Wix user Avi Cohen, owner of <a href="https://www.babuchocolates.com/" target="_blank" >Babu Chocolates</a>, manages rising costs of his raw product by experimenting with new product offerings. He plays with flavors and uses an assortment of ingredients like different nuts so that he never loses quality when supplies are out of reach.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_36a7746639b14b3fa9088b4512301cd0~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_641,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="Babu Chocolate home page"></figure> <p>Additionally, honest communication between businesses and consumers might be the easiest way to navigate these broader challenges and could pay off in the long run. </p> <p>For example, <a href="https://time.com/6128977/brands-announce-price-increases/" target="_blank" >Time magazine reported</a> that some small businesses are being clear about their price increases, telling their customers what’s going on in advance and gaining their trust as a result. </p> <h3>02. Finding customers without being a household name </h3> <p>For 49% of marketers, the primary objective around sales is increasing customer acquisition, released B2B research-based marketing firm Ascend2 <a href="https://ascend2.com/new-research-digital-marketing-plans-for-2020/" target="_blank" >in its 2020 digital marketing report</a>. However, the process of finding new customers can be costly and specifically challenging for smaller businesses that do not have the same budget (and big name) as larger companies. </p> <p>Small business owners, self creators and aspiring <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2020/01/how-to-become-an-entrepreneur/" target="_blank" >entrepreneurs</a> have a few ways to attract new clients without being a household name. First, position yourself as an expert in your industry by creating a blog and publishing helpful content that demonstrates your knowledge to potential customers. </p> <p>Second, optimize your small business website for search engines and further drive traffic and conversion. Along with using best practices like <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2019/04/website-speed-optimization/" target="_blank" >page speed optimization</a> and <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/06/responsive-vs-adaptive-design" target="_blank" >designing</a> for enhanced user experience, you will also want to track your success by monitoring the right key performance indicators (KPIs). </p> <h3>03. Increasing brand awareness </h3><p>Having a strong brand is important for <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/04/business-growth/" target="_blank" >growing a business</a>. Increasing brand awareness is one part of that picture, resulting in building a loyal customer base who can recognize your brand instantly out of a lineup and also trust your business to meet their needs. In effect, 46% of consumers say that they would pay more for brands they trust, <a href="https://www.salsify.com/resources/report/content-2022-salsify-consumer-research-the-value-of-building-brand-trust" target="_blank" >according to a 2022 marketing survey by Salsify</a>. Small business owners and entrepreneurs can boost their brand awareness using their best marketing tool: their website. </p> <p>Start by building an SEO strategy to bring more traffic to your site. This can really help with your business <a href="https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/scalability" target="_blank" >scalability.</a> Then, create a professional and customized logo design with the <a href="https://www.wix.com/logo/maker" target="_blank" >Wix Logo Maker</a> to feature on your website. On the content side, you can blog, start a podcast, and share social media visuals such as infographics that show off your brand’s expertise. </p> <h3>04. Workforce woes </h3> <p>Small business owners are in a pinch amid a hiring crisis that stems from the pandemic. “Workers are leaving their jobs in record numbers due to lack of child care, low wages, fear of COVID-19, long commutes, and changing values and priorities,” said Betsy Dougert, vice president of external relations for SCORE, the US largest network of expert business mentors. </p> <p>Small business owners <a href="https://www.score.org/resource/megaphone-main-street-small-business-jobs-report-0" target="_blank" >reported</a> that “hiring the right talent” has been their biggest challenge yet, followed by “retaining or motivating employees.” <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mentoring.redesign/s3fs-public/Fall%202021%20Megaphone%20of%20Main%20Street%20Small%20Business%20Jobs%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" >The Megaphone of Main Street: Small Business Jobs Report</a> also revealed that hiring and retention has been particularly difficult right now since small businesses need to raise salaries and wages to be competitive and attract quality candidates. </p> <p>Some small businesses use online recruitment and employment agencies to address their own labor shortage. “Right now, we’re doing whatever we can to attract the workers that we need,” said Traci Tapani, co-president of Wyoming Machine, <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/workforce/how-one-small-business-is-finding-workers-in-a-tight-job-market" target="_blank" >as reported by the US Chamber of Commerce</a>. </p> <h3>05. Lack of capital and cash flow</h3> <p>Capital and cash flow are a lifeline, especially for those <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2019/10/how-to-start-a-business/" target="_blank" >starting a business</a>, giving them the financial support to expand and evolve. The SMB Group, a research, analysis and consulting firm, <a href="https://www.smb-gr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/COVID-2-ebook-final-1.pdf" target="_blank" >found business owners in the last couple of years</a> were dealing with unprecedented uncertainty of cash flow and lack of capital. </p> <p>Fortunately, there are different ways of obtaining funding, from Small Business Administration loans to private bank loans. The SBA offers a variety of <a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans" target="_blank" >loan programs</a> to help small businesses, including 7(a) loans, 504 loans and microloans. Other methods of funding include finding an investor, venture capitalist or business partner, as well as <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/09/what-is-crowdfunding/" target="_blank" >crowdfunding</a> online. </p> <p>The next step is maintaining your <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/11/bookkeeping/" target="_blank" >bookkeeping</a> and proper cash flow management to ensure enough cash reserves to cover business bills and generate profits. Without it, you may not be able to scale. </p><h3>06. Marketing </h3><p>Nearly half of small business owners handle marketing efforts on their own, <a href="https://www.fundera.com/resources/small-business-marketing-statistics" target="_blank" >reported Fundera</a>, a marketplace for business financial solutions. With smaller budgets than their big brand counterparts, small businesses need to be creative and resourceful about their digital marketing strategy—and many need an online presence to get there. </p> <p>Thankfully, the cost to build a website and operate it is relatively affordable. Choose a website plan—<a href="https://www.wix.com/ecommerce/website" target="_blank" >eCommerce</a>, <a href="https://www.wix.com/event/website" target="_blank" >event website</a> or <a href="https://www.wix.com/portfolio-website" target="_blank" >portfolio</a>—for your <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/01/types-of-businesses/" target="_blank" >type of business</a>. Then, incorporate additional marketing features to enhance your website, including email marketing, SEO tools, analytics, and different website apps from the <a href="https://www.wix.com/app-market" target="_blank" >Wix app market</a>. </p> <h3>07. Burnout </h3> <p>More workers across the board feel worse than they did last year, <a href="https://www.metlife.com/employee-benefit-trends/" target="_blank" >according to MetLife’s Employee Benefit Trends Study 2022</a>. “Malaise, burnout, depression and stress-all of those are up considerably, Todd Katz, executive vice president at MetLife<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/business/pandemic-burnout-productivity.html" target="_blank" > told the <em>New York Times</em></a>. Employees and employers alike feel fried in a late-pandemic crisis of productivity and will. </p> <p>While being a small business owner can be rewarding, it can also be emotionally draining. When you’re "always on” for your <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/09/what-is-business-development/" target="_blank" >business development</a>, paired with the stresses of inflation, rising costs, and the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, it’s important to recognize the signs of burnout, as per the <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/28-05-2019-burn-out-an-occupational-phenomenon-international-classification-of-diseases" target="_blank" >World Health Organization</a>: </p><ul> <li>Feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion; </li> <li>Increased mental distance from one’s job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one’s job; </li> <li>And reduced professional efficacy </li> </ul> <p>Here are a few ways to beat ongoing stress, especially for business owners:</p> <ul> <li>Invest in help to delegate tasks, such as accounting, updating the company website or marketing;</li> <li>“Close up shop” temporarily and recharge;</li> <li>Take time to celebrate victories, big or small, to keep a positive attitude</li> <li>Keep up with the latest <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/07/travel-technology-trends/" target="_blank" >technology trends </a>that can help streamline business operations</li> </ul> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6542d9_14f806dccd7449d9bbde1963800fc40b~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_60,h_60,al_c,q_80/file.png" ></figure><p><strong>By Cecilia Lazzaro </strong></p> <p>Small Business Expert & Writer </p> ]]>

Between writing content and choosing the perfect visuals, some fundamental elements may fall by the wayside. But make sure you don't overlook one important thing: your website fonts, also known as typography.</p> <p>Typography is defined as the visual representation of type. In other words, it's the fonts you use to communicate your content and brand voice. In some cases, it can communicate more about your brand than words alone. Your selected fonts should amplify your brand voice and <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/05/web-design/" target="_blank" >web design</a>, while looking sharp on the screen and easily conveying information.</p> <p>In this guide, we’ll discuss twenty of the best website fonts, as well as tips for choosing the right ones for you. </p> <h2>The primary types of website fonts</h2> <p>The art of <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2020/02/what-is-typography/" target="_blank" >typography</a> is rich and complex—ranging from aesthetics to text alignment and spacing. Before we dive into our 20 favorites, it’s important to understand the three main types of fonts: serif, sans serif and script. This will help you better understand each and narrow down which best fonts will suit your overall website design.</p> <p>Here’s a quick summary:</p> <h3>Serif fonts</h3> <p>A serif is a small line at the end of a stroke in a letter or symbol. Many consider serif fonts as classical and elegant, and they are mostly associated with print publishing. Examples include Times New Roman, Georgia and Bodoni.</p> <p> </p> <h3>Sans serif fonts</h3> <p>These fonts don't contain serif lines at the end of their letters. Sans serifs are clean, modern and often neutral-looking, making them a great fit for web design. Examples include Wix's own <a href="https://www.wix.com/typeface/madefor" target="_blank" >Madefor</a> font, Helvetica and the <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/creative/2020/03/why-do-people-hate-comic-sans/" target="_blank" >infamous Comic Sans</a>.</p> <h3>Script fonts</h3> <p>Scripts, including cursive fonts, are modeled after handwriting styles. Keep this style limited to titles only, as visitors may find it hard to read body text in a script font. Examples include Lobster and Lucida Handwriting.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5e5a34_f38fe61d597d45d58fc78a6209654438~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000,h_625,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="A chart displaying the font classifications of Serif, sans serif and script fonts "></figure><h2>20 of the best website fonts </h2> <p>These 20 fonts are ideal for <a href="https://www.wix.com/website/design" target="_blank" >website design</a> since they are easy-to-read and can fit a variety of website types. Several of them come in font families, meaning each font has multiple versions that you can use throughout your website copy.</p> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> In case you’re <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/02/how-to-make-a-website/" target="_blank" >making a website on Wix</a>, you can use all these beautiful fonts on the Editor, in addition to hundreds of other typefaces.

Your fonts should match your brand voice and design theme</h3> <p>Fonts are an indispensable component of branding. Ensure that your font scheme is cohesive with the rest of your visual brand assets, such as email and newsletter text, business cards, slogans and <a href="https://www.wix.com/logo/maker" target="_blank" >logo design</a>.</p> <p>Whether it's sophisticated and trendy or rugged and adventurous, <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/creative/2018/10/lettering-typography-design-inspiration/" target="_blank" >typography design</a> should contribute to your website’s story. Consider your website's purpose and your overall design theme, as well as the niche that you want to attract. Then, choose fonts that align.</p> <h3>02. Make sure fonts are readable</h3> <p>Readability is one of the most important web design aspects. How well users can read the text on your site affects how well and how quickly they comprehend the presented information.</p> <p>Poor font choices, small letters and multiple uncomplimentary fonts can discourage users from reading your content and even keep them from spending time on your site. </p> <h3>03. Use complementary fonts</h3> <p>Don't use more than three fonts on your website. Not only will this practice improve your site's design and make it easier to read, but limiting the number of fonts will make your website more accessible, too.</p> <p>If using multiple fonts, choose a primary font, a secondary font and an optional accent font. You can also opt for a font family in which each font varies slightly in design but complement each other throughout the same website.</p> <p><strong>Primary fonts: </strong>Your primary font<strong> </strong>is the most visible one, and you should use it on the headers and titles throughout your website. Visitors will most associate this font with your brand, even if you don't use it the most throughout your site. As a result, the primary font can be more dominant and distinct than the rest of your fonts.</p> <p><strong>Secondary fonts: </strong>You'll use your secondary font across the bulk of your website’s written content. This includes paragraphs, descriptions, blog articles and more. While your primary font can be eye-catching and unique, your secondary font should be, first and foremost, highly legible. Visitors will find it hard to read ornate fonts over long chunks of texts.</p> <p><strong>Accent fonts: </strong>Finally, you'll only use your accent font for a very specific purpose. When it comes to websites, the accent font is usually reserved for calls-to-action, since they can draw attention to your most important buttons on the page. </p> <p>When deciding which fonts to combine, you can choose from many methods. Consider that opposites can work well together by creating contrast, so perhaps you want to try a simple, serif font with a more futuristic sans serif option. You can also stick to fonts that belong to the same family, too. Since they pair well, doing so can provide consistency throughout your site.</p> <p>To help you mix and match typefaces for your website, here are our designers’ favorite font pairings:</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5e5a34_c27c6f08baa7485f8463fb900849911d~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="A chart displaying 5 different font combinations for a website"></figure><h3>04. Consider website speed and performance</h3> <p>Larger files and more intricate web design elements affect the speed and <a href="https://www.wix.com/performance" target="_blank" >performance of your site</a>. This applies to website fonts, too. If you’re using third-party fonts from Google, for example, you can assume that these fonts will affect loading speed more than web-safe fonts. Web-safe fonts refer to common fonts that exist by default on computers and don’t need to be downloaded (Arial, Times New Roman, Verdana, Tahoma, Palatino and Garabond are some of the most common examples of web-safe fonts).</p> <p>Every font you use increases page load speed, so you’ll need to optimize your web fonts. Some of the best ways to do this include not using more than 3 fonts and using less text where possible. Another tip is to implement <a href="https://support.wix.com/en/article/cookies-and-your-wix-site" target="_blank" >cookies on your site</a>, which allows browsers to store website fonts so it doesn’t need to download them over and over. </p> <p>As a precaution, set a fallback, web safe font in case your user's device can't display your chosen font. This can happen if there’s a glitch on your site, or if a user accesses your site from an older computer or has a slower connection.</p> <h3>05. Account for website accessibility </h3> <p><a href="https://ddiy.co/web-accessibility-statistics/" target="_blank" >75% of Americans with disabilities</a> use the internet on a daily basis, 3.3% of which are visually impaired. Anyone designing a website should consider creating an online experience accessible to all. Certain fonts can be hard for anyone to read, even if they aren’t dealing with issues like vision impairment or dyslexia.</p> <p>To create an accessible website, use clear, straightforward typefaces that are free of excess ligatures. Not only can screen readers more easily comprehend these fonts, but visually impaired individuals can navigate your site more easily, too. Your typefaces should have distinct letters, not be cluttered and take <a href="https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/kerning" target="_blank" >kerning </a>into account (amount of space between individual characters of a font). </p> <h3>06. Determine sizing and visual weight</h3> <p>Once you’ve chosen your website fonts, you’ll need to decide on different letter sizes for large titles, subtitles and paragraph text. Apart from size, additional factors that impact a font's visual weight include stylistic components like bold, italic or underlining. However, excessive use of these styles may result in an overwhelming effect and could ultimately detract from your message, so use them in moderation.</p> <p>To get you started, we’ve put together these ranges as a general guideline for most websites:</p> <p><strong>Titles: </strong>30-70px</p> <p><strong>Subtitles:</strong> 22-30px</p> <p><strong>Paragraph: </strong>16-20px</p> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you’re creating a website on Wix, you can <a href="https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-customizing-and-saving-text-themes" target="_blank" >customize and save text themes</a> so that your titles, subtitles, and paragraph text will always maintain a consistent font, size and weight.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/984ed3_22c8ed6246df44719f504ad612128cda~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_60,h_60,al_c,q_80/file.png" ></figure><p><strong>By Blake Stimac</strong></p> <p>Community & Social Media Manager</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5e5a34_146c24fe3d084709801dbb1aec245d38~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_60,h_60,al_c,q_80/file.png" ></figure><p><strong>By Eden Spivak</strong></p> <p>Design Expert & Writer</p> ]]>

When you take your business online, you'll need a powerful digital marketing strategy that captures your brand message perfectly and promotes it across several channels. Today, we’ll take a close look at one of the most effective tools for doing just that—the landing page.</p> <p>A critical tool for promoting your brand, landing pages have enormous power in driving conversions. By using a<a href="https://www.wix.com/landing-page-builder" target="_blank" > landing page builder</a> to design and customize your landing pages, you can precisely target your audience and guide them through the sales funnel.</p> <p>In this article, we’ll discuss the definition of a landing page, explain <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2015/11/create-a-powerful-free-landing-page-in-under-an-hour/" target="_blank" >how to create a landing page</a> and offer some best practices for designing your own.</p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_osCHbFt-C8&t=6s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_osCHbFt-C8&t=6s</a><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_30b1692c16c8412ea4a689675a00db32~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_82,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="create a landing page CTA"></figure> <h2>What is a landing page?</h2> <p>A <a href="https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/landing-page" target="_blank" >landing page</a> is the destination for people interested in learning more about your business after seeing your online marketing or advertising campaign. Not to be confused with a splash page or a <a href="https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/microsite" target="_blank" >microsite</a>, landing pages entice users to click on a strategic call-to-action (CTA), such as “Get Started,” “Subscribe,” or “Buy Now.” Landing pages focus on a single goal, typically conversion or lead generation. This precision makes them highly effective and lowers the costs of acquiring leads and making sales.</p> <h3>Landing pages vs websites</h3> <p>The main difference between a website's homepage and a landing page is that a landing page is specific and a homepage is multifaceted. A homepage's content introduces, whereas a landing page provides information tailored to its desired aim. </p> <p>As we’ve mentioned, a landing page only has one goal; homepages, on the other hand, have various goals. For that reason, a homepage typically contains a variety of links. Landing pages typically only provide one link to keep visitors focused on the primary CTA. Therefore, landing pages only provide visitors with two options: to convert or exit the page.</p> <p>To give you a better sense of the difference between the two, we've provided an example template of each below:</p> <p>Homepage template:</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/0e0314_3642339f21544545aa41567f47b0f9d2~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_612,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="A homepage template that has multiple CTAs, links and images."></figure> <p>Landing page template:</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/0e0314_622a870ee77248e39714c486e7daa495~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_612,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="A landing page template that only has a single CTA and doesn't have a navigation bar."></figure> <h3>Types of landing pages</h3> <p>When considering which landing page type suits your business, think about your goals. Do you want to gather contact information for leads? Are you offering a unique sale? Do you want to collect RSVPs for an event? Focusing directly on this goal will help you build a precise and highly targeted page. Let’s discuss the most common <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/03/types-of-landing-pages/" target="_blank" >types of landing pages</a>:</p> <ul> <li>Long-form landing page: As the name suggests, a long-form landing page is the longest type of landing page. It features a significant amount of content, including extensive information about a product or service and imagery that emphasizes the value the product or service can provide. Because of that, long-form sales pages can be attractive for search optimization purposes.</li> </ul><ul> <li>Product landing page: If you have a product that you want to spotlight, consider creating a product landing page. You can use it to delve into the product's functionality, features and benefits.</li> </ul><ul> <li>Event landing page: If hosting an event, create an event landing page to make promoting your event so much easier. It offers a convenient way for interested people to learn more, RSVP or purchase tickets.</li> </ul><ul> <li>Lead-generation landing page: Also called a “lead-gen” or a “lead-capture” page, a lead-generation landing page generates leads by collecting information about your audience. It typically includes a form where visitors can submit their contact information. Lead-gen landing pages can help you gain insight into your potential customers as well as how to reach them. To encourage users to enter their details, offer an incentive such as a coupon code, e-book, webinar or exclusive newsletter content.</li> </ul><ul> <li>Unsubscribe landing page: An unsubscribe landing page gives you one last chance to keep customers who signed up for your email marketing in the marketing funnel. You can offer incentives to make their subscription more appealing, over the option to change the frequency of emails or remind them what they will lose if they decide to unsubscribe.</li> </ul><ul> <li>Coming soon landing page: A coming soon landing page can help stir up enthusiasm for your upcoming business. Consider posting your planned launch date and creating a “notify me” form so that they will know when the site officially goes live. </li> </ul><ul> <li>Thank-you landing page: Because thank-you landing pages appear once a customer has performed an action—such as making a purchase or sharing their contact information—they can effectively nurture leads and retain customers. “You can use a thank-you landing page to create an additional funnel by offering them another incentive,” said Jane Musatova, a Wix product marketing manager with loads of landing page experience.</li> </ul><ul> <li>Click-through landing page: This type of landing page typically has a CTA that sends visitors directly into the checkout flow, nudging them to buy or subscribe. eCommerce or SaaS sites focused on making immediate sales commonly use click-through landing pages.</li> </ul> <h2>What is the purpose of landing pages?</h2> <p>Landing pages offer enormous growth potential for your company and can help your business continue to flourish. Incorporate landing pages into your<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/12/marketing-strategies/" target="_blank" > marketing strategies</a> for the following benefits:</p> <h3>01. They dramatically improve your conversion rate</h3> <p>As mentioned earlier, landing pages focus on a single goal and compel your visitors to take action. In doing so, they move people further down the marketing funnel—from anonymous visitors to leads and finally to paying customers.</p> <h3>02. They tell you about your audience</h3> <p>If you include a signup form on your landing page, you can ask for information about your audience’s demographics to gain a better understanding of your target market. On top of that, the channels that work—or don’t—for your landing page promotion say a lot about your prospective customers' interests and habits. You can use this information to holistically optimize your targeting efforts and marketing strategy.</p> <h3>03. They increase brand awareness</h3> <p>An attractive, well-designed landing page conveys your brand's professionalism, value and appeal. Not only can landing pages convert leads in the moment, but they help bolster your brand simply by getting the word out. The more people that know about you, the better off your business.</p> <h3>04. They are measurable</h3> <p>By analyzing metrics such as conversions, bounce rate, page views and traffic source, you can get a sense of how a particular marketing campaign perform. Take a look at where the traffic comes from—for instance, a paid post or an email marketing campaign—to determine which marketing assets prove most effective.</p> <h2>What is the anatomy of a landing page?</h2> <p>Let’s go over the basic elements of<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/03/landing-page-design/" target="_blank" > landing page design</a> so that you’ll know exactly what to include:</p> <ul> <li>Visuals: You have less than <a href="http://ng-do-users-stay-on-web-pages/" target="_blank" >20 seconds</a> to convince your audience to stick around long enough to learn anything from your landing page. Design is your greatest tool for doing so.</li> </ul><ul> <li>Headlines: Because customers typically skim through landing pages, they may only read the headlines before decide whether to respond to your CTA. For that reason, make your headlines direct, enticing and brief. This will be the most challenging part of building your landing page, because you have to convince them in three to seven words that your offering provides value.</li> </ul><ul> <li>CTAs: Calls-to-actions (CTAs), which are the prompts you’ll use to encourage readers to take a specific action, are typically two to four words long. “Subscribe Now,” “Start Your Free Trial,” “Learn More” and “Request a Demo” are a few good examples.</li> </ul><ul> <li>Summary of benefits: The summary of benefits should be your landing page's most detailed section. Here, you can provide more information to interested readers who want to learn more. Remember to keep the summary simple. Rather than getting into the nitty gritty, use the space to emphasize the specific benefits they will get from hitting the CTA button.</li> </ul><ul> <li>Social proof: Don’t expect readers to take your word for it. Include testimonials, reviews and awards on your landing page to prove to readers that your claims are valid and customers actually benefit from the touted features.</li> </ul><ul> <li>Closing statement: The readers who make it to the bottom of your page likely want your offering, so the closing statement should give them the final push to hit that CTA button. It doesn’t have to be extensive—you can wrap everything up with a strong headline and CTA.</li> </ul> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_4925454ea60b45fc81e366ca8330b66c~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_929,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="A landing page template that points to the headline and CTA above the fold, a summary of benefits and customer testimonials in the middle and a closing statement at the bottom."></figure> <h2>Landing page best practices</h2> <p>As you develop your campaign, keep in mind these <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/05/landing-page-best-practices/" target="_blank" >landing page best practices</a> to create the most effective one for your business:</p> <h3>01. Perform A/B testing</h3> <p>With A/B testing, you can test headlines, formats, designs and CTAs to see what performs best. For example, you could use an A/B test to determine whether your CTA button should say “Buy Now” or “Get Started,” based on which has the higher conversion rate. Musatova recommends using Google Optimize or Hotjar for your A/B testing. </p> <h3>02. Minimize navigation</h3> <p>To create a straight path from your landing page to the desired action, remove as many links as possible. You can even remove the navigation bar. Ideally, your CTA button will be the only link—any others that need to be on the page should take up as little real estate as possible.</p> <h3>03. Maximize readability</h3> <p>Long chunks of text can bore, overwhelm and distract your visitors. On the other hand, making your text short, sweet and skimmable will grab hold of your audience’s attention right away. Every word should serve a very specific purpose and bring their eyes directly to the CTA. Don't get too creative with your content here—save that for your blog. </p> <h3>04. Maintain consistency</h3> <p>“What is most important in creating landing pages is consistency in messaging and design,” said Musatova. To prevent any confusion while moving from point A to point B, make sure your marketing asset's content matches that of your landing page. For example, the SEO headline for the landing page should match the one that appears above the fold. Additionally, your landing page's branding and formatting should coordinate with your site’s homepage. This will allow your audience to move seamlessly through your marketing funnel with ease and minimal distraction.</p> <h3>05. Make your CTA prominent</h3> <p>Your landing page should include a CTA that stands out. To achieve this, use clear and direct language and a CTA button that contrasts visually from the background. Place the CTA button multiple times across the landing page so that visitors don’t need to hunt for it.</p> <h3>06. Target specific markets</h3> <p>An effective landing page targets potential customers in a specific stage of the marketing funnel. You’ll want the page's content to keep with your audience's intent. Once you’ve segmented leads, you can even create a few versions of the same landing page to better target different groups of potential customers.</p> <h3>07. Simplify actions</h3> <p>The more you simplify the action you’re expecting readers to take, the more likely they will do so. For example, Musatova recommends limiting forms to only the most essential information. “You don’t want to scare people away with long, time-consuming forms,” she explained. “People also get a bit concerned about sharing information.” You might even consider only asking for email addresses and finding out more information later.</p> <h3>08. Focus on the consumer</h3> <p>Your landing page's content should focus on the reader rather than your company. Instead of talking about how great your business is and all of its achievements, focus on the ways your offer can benefit the customer.</p> <h3>09. Place important content above the fold</h3> <p>Don’t depend on visitors to scroll to convert. Place at least one CTA button above the fold where it’s immediately visible. Place other key elements of your landing page, such as the image and headline, above the fold as well.</p> <h3>10. Make it mobile-friendly</h3> <p>Make sure your landing page not only looks great on any device, but that it also loads quickly. A good portion of your traffic will come from mobile browsing, and these visitors will be less likely to convert if the page looks clunky on their smaller screen or if it loads too slow.</p> <h3>11. Use landing page templates</h3> <p><a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2019/09/free-landing-page-templates/" target="_blank" >Landing page templates</a> are the quickest, easiest way to build an optimized page for your site. Professional designers and marketing experts built these templates, so they’re destined to drive conversions and make sales. You can also fully customize each one to best fit your branding. You can even use the opportunity to design two different pages and see which one performs better amongst your audience.</p> <h2>How to get traffic to your landing pages</h2> <p>Now for the fun part—bringing visitors to your landing page so they can convert. Try these four avenues to grow traffic:</p> <h3>01. Social media</h3> <p>As one of the most prominent platforms for engaging with your target audience, start promoting your landing page on social media. Whether it’s on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter or Pinterest, create a compelling post with a link to your landing page. That way, you’ll target people already interested in your brand and bring in quality traffic.</p> <h3>02. Email marketing</h3> <p>Email marketing remains one of the most effective methods for attracting traffic to your landing page. If you nail the email subject line, visuals, layout and copywriting, your landing page will get a noticeable boost of incoming visits.</p> <h3>03. SEO</h3> <p>Optimizing your landing pages for Google search rankings ensures that the right people will be able to find it. To start, do some research into which keyword SERPs best fit your landing page using SEO tools such as Ahrefs or Semrush. Once you decide on the primary keyword you want the page to rank for, work it into the copy whenever possible, as well as your SEO title and description.</p> <p><a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank" >Creating a website</a> with Wix means that you can customize your on-page SEO, including meta tags, URL slugs, canonical tags and other page elements. Headers, for example, improve readability for the user, but also contribute to the HTML language that Google reads to determine website ranking. When Google scans website content, it uses headers to help analyze a website or web page's information. Headers are arranged in a hierarchy from H1 to H6, with H1 as the page title. </p> <p>Keep in mind that SEO isn’t a quick-and-dirty strategy that produces immediate effort—it requires sustained attention. The effort pays off because a landing page can maintain SEO authority it has accumulated over time.</p> <h3>04. Paid ads</h3> <p>Social media marketing, email marketing and SEO are free ways to draw traffic to your landing page. However, if you think you could use an additional boost, consider promoting your landing page via paid ads. By targeting people based on their interests and demographics, you prompt them with the landing page designated for their specific niche.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Search results ads:</strong> Based on keywords that you define, search results ads show up on search engines when people include those terms in their queries.</li> </ul><ul> <li><strong>Social media ads:</strong> When you create paid social media posts, social networks like Facebook and Instagram promote them to people who match the profile of your target audience.</li> </ul><ul> <li><strong>Display ads: </strong>Another option is to use third-party advertising tools to place banner ads on the websites your audience frequents.</li> </ul> <p>Based on your campaign goals, you may choose to diversify your advertising efforts or focus on just one of these platforms. Whichever you decide, consistently monitor your results so that you can adapt your campaign accordingly.</p> <h2>Landing page examples </h2> <p>To better understand how to implement these strategies, take a look at these<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2019/05/best-landing-page-examples/" target="_blank" > landing page examples</a>:</p> <h3>01.

Start here: </p><h3>01. Build a business plan</h3> <p>To understand what you need, where you fit in the market and how to price your product or service, you’ll want to create a business plan. Include the following components—all available in this free template: executive summary, company description, product and services, market analysis, marketing, management plans, financial projections and any additional information to help with your business roadmap. </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6542d9_ad35fe6bfcf9456aa2ee1e93db4ea719~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_75,al_c,q_80/file.png" ></figure><h3>02. Apply for licenses, permits </h3> <p>Before you can take your mobile business to the streets, you will need to acquire the right permits and licenses. Some U.S. cities limit the number of truck permits issued at a time. So check your municipal website to find out more about whether you can apply and how. </p> <p>For food and drink services, you will need to follow instructions on the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/fda-food-code/state-retail-and-food-service-codes-and-regulations-state" target="_blank" >Board of Health regulations website</a>. Your business will be subject to health department inspectors and food checks. </p> <h3>03. Find parking </h3> <p><em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em>’s Charles Boyle famously addressed the food truck struggle of fighting for the perfect parking spot <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-szVGVj_2_8" target="_blank" >in this clip</a>, but the truth is greater than fiction. Cities like New York enact strict parking rules and regulations, and vehicle owners must adhere or pay a fine. Do your research to know where you can and cannot park your truck, or opt for a reliable parking garage.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6542d9_14f806dccd7449d9bbde1963800fc40b~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_60,h_60,al_c,q_80/file.png" ></figure><p><strong>By Cecilia Lazzaro </strong></p> <p>Small Business Expert & Writer </p> ]]>

He curated even the smallest details of his portfolio and online presence in line with his brand identity, a 3D-style inspired by the softer side of hip hop synonymous with the music of the 2010s. Muted colors, rounded edges and his distinct cartoon style breathes life into each of his creations, while also impressively showcasing his skills. He quickly found that he could use his portfolio to guide his viewers in the exact way he wanted them to interact or interpret his art. </p> <p>But as the online world continues to evolve, Nedavius has found that his website does more than just showcase his work. It has gradually and organically grown a new community centered around art and music. It started when he wanted to tell more of the story behind his work on social media, so he wrote in-depth blog posts to accompany the posts, leading users back to his website to discover more of his work. </p> <p>“Social media can die out at any time. A website is there to stay,” Nedavius says. “I wanted my own way to show my work in case anything else fails. A website gives more of a look into you than social media and can be an experience that people want to go back to.”</p> <p>We sat down with Wix user and digital artist Nedavius to pick his brain on his journey to success through digital mediums and how he’s continuing to grow his business while staying true to his artistic sensibilities:</p> <p><strong><em>Tip:</em></strong><em> If you’re looking to create a </em><a href="https://www.wix.com/portfolio-website" target="_blank" ><em>portfolio website</em></a><em> to showcase your work, add personal touches to your site that aligns with your brand identity. For example, Nedavius used his 3D animations as site icons on his website.</em></p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_987de0b311ec45aa86481f9ba218718a~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_623,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="Nedavius's experiential website " alt="homepage for Nedavius in the Wix Editor"></figure><h3>Wix: Describe your journey </h3> <p><strong>Nedavius:</strong> I’m a digital artist based in New York. Since 2016 I’ve been sharing my art online, starting out with illustrations of my friends and favorite artists, then Photoshop collages of music album covers and eventually diving into 3D illustration and animation at the start of 2020.</p> <h3>What motivates you?</h3> <p>I’m motivated by the act of inspiring people, and the fact that the future is an open book—and through art, design, we can build the stories and write the future.</p> <h3>Where do you see yourself in the future? How do you see your personal brand evolving? </h3><p> </p> <p>I see myself expanding my creativity into more areas—animated films, toys, apparel, community events and more unimagined places.</p> <h3>What or who inspires you? And where do you look for inspiration?</h3> <p>Music is where I find my biggest inspiration. Whether it's the stories told through music, the feelings it evokes or the connection to a time, place, event, or person that it holds. I’ve always transmuted those aspects through visual form. Outside of music, I look for inspiration in everyday life. </p> <h3>How do you generate new ideas?</h3> <p>By digesting a lot of different art, whether through social media, online archives, movies/shows from the past and especially books more recently. I think the more you take in, the more possibilities you’re aware of and the more unanswered questions or unexplored areas you can create from.</p> <h3>How do you measure success?</h3> <p>Success to me is a combination of the freedom to be yourself and impacting others through that—living through creation and inspiration, not just survival.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_251f47c634bf416092162b46cf1dedbe~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_623,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="Wix Editor updating Nedavius's portfolio website"></figure><h3>What design are you most proud of?</h3> <p>So far, my website—specifically the <a href="https://www.nedavius.com/process-v4" target="_blank" >nedavius.com/process</a> site [a digital installation that takes users through an interactive experience of <a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank" >creating a website</a> with Wix.] Initially it was just a thesis project for graduation, but it has impacted many people beyond that. It’s motivating to me and gets me excited to keep developing it more.</p> <h3>What is the best career advice you’ve been given?</h3> <p>The importance of patience and consistency, focusing on enjoying the journey and loving that more than whatever you think the end goal is.</p> <h3>What has been your biggest challenge since you started?</h3> <p>One of my biggest challenges has been staying away from burnout. It’s easy to get excited over ideas, say yes to everything and want to execute it all at once. With how fast-paced the world is today, it’s a challenge to practice patience and balance to create something timeless.</p> <h3>What advice would you give to a new creator?</h3><blockquote>“Don’t think, just make. Early on, thinking can easily turn into overthinking and then stagnation. Create and move forward always, no matter how small the steps.”</blockquote> <h3>For cover art specifically, can you share your process? How does the sound of the music spark creativity?</h3> <p>The process is really a conversation between the music and/or the artist. A lot of times the artists have an idea of what their music ‘looks’ like to them. I just carve the details to life. When I hear the music I try to take the tone, the feelings and the lyrics in to transmute them visually.</p> <h3>How do you feel 3D design and movement are changing the design world?</h3> <p>I think it's changing the design world in good and bad ways. When combined with technology, it’s allowed for more innovation; when combined with art, it lets us create more interactive and engaging worlds. And I love that as it grows, more learning resources are coming along with it, which allows even more innovation. But ideas like a totally digital, 3D <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/09/what-is-the-metaverse/" target="_blank" >metaverse</a> are a bit scary.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_d4890bf16d7e4e4ba8ac9b003347bf46~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_623,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="About page on Nedavius's website porfolio"></figure><h3>How have NFTs changed the way you approach digital art?</h3> <p>It’s allowed for more freedom—as a digital artist specifically, in the past you were confined to a certain level of creativity or a certain set of pathways if you wanted to live off of your art. Where a painter can paint and sell the canvas in galleries, a digital artist would have to approach their art through some other commercialized means—turning it into a t-shirt, a poster, stickers, etc.—which oftentimes can devalue the art itself. </p> <p>Although the world mostly sees commercialized <a href="https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/what-is-an-nft" target="_blank" >NFTs</a> as huge projects where art comes second to profit, the scope of NFTs has opened up a huge window of opportunity for digital artists to create more freely, live off of their creativity and build more community around their art.</p> <p><strong>Want to get started on building your online presence?

Not only that, but it can also empower other areas of your <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/12/marketing-strategies/" target="_blank" >marketing strategy</a>. </p> <p>User-generated content can increase brand awareness and solidify your business as both competitive and trustworthy. But before opening your platform for customers, employees and business stakeholders to post their images, videos, audio and text, you need to know a few important components about building a user-generated content strategy. </p> <p>This article will tackle the benefits, best practices and how to make user-generated content part of your marketing efforts. We'll review:</p> <ul> <li>What is user-generated content? </li> <li>Top 4 reasons brands should implement user-generated content</li> <li>How to incorporate a user-generated content into your marketing strategy</li> <li>Best practices for sharing user-generated content </li> <li>Examples of user-generated content to inspire your next campaign </li> </ul> <h2>What is user-generated content?</h2> <p>User-generated content (UGC) is any content that didn’t originate from your brand, but rather your audience. This can refer to a range of content types—including photos, videos, reviews, comments or even blog posts. Essentially, UGC includes your brand, but your in-house marketing team doesn’t create the assets. </p> <p>While this may seem like a fancy new <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/06/types-of-marketing/" target="_blank" >type of marketing</a>, user-generated content is essentially just word-of-mouth referrals for the online age. Think of a user posting about a brand’s product just like a recommendation from a friend. </p> <p>In some cases, the advertised brand doesn’t sponsor user-generated content, but someone who finds inspiration in the brand or its products creates content about it. This makes it, oftentimes, feel more authentic and trustworthy than traditional advertisements. Brands can also pay for user-generated content, but this can cross over into sponsored content territory, which doesn’t touch audiences in the same organic way. </p> <h2>Top 4 reasons brands should implement user-generated-content </h2> <p>Few other <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2020/04/what-is-content-marketing/" target="_blank" >content marketing</a> forms allow you to accomplish so many goals simultaneously. From increasing traffic to your websites to interacting with customers, user-generated content can check off almost all your boxes when it comes to running branding campaigns. </p> <p>Let’s dive into a few ways user-generated content can grow your company into a recognizable and profitable brand. </p> <h3>01. User generated content promotes authenticity and trustworthiness</h3> <p>In an age where most people perceive the staging and photoshopping associated with traditional advertising as inauthentic, user-generated content shines through as more transparent and trustworthy. Brands today cannot afford to overlook authenticity. In fact, <a href=" https://www.oberlo.com/blog/branding-statistics" target="_blank" >86% of consumers</a> say authenticity drives them to decide which brands to support, and a further 81% agree that they can’t purchase from a brand that they don’t trust. Using user-generated content in campaigns to promote their brand, companies can prove their authenticity.</p> <h3>02. Allows potential clients to evaluate your brand</h3> <p><a href="http://learn.podium.com/rs/841-BRM-380/images/2017-SOOR-Infographic.jpg" target="_blank" >93% of consumers read reviews</a> before committing to make a purchase. To grow a successful brand, you must collect online reviews, but that doesn’t mean you have to do with a cut-and-dry product review page. While these help customers, clients can learn about a brand or product in more engaging ways.</p> <p>User-generated reviews are powerful, and their unfiltered nature resonates well with audiences. Whether an Instagram user uploads a story about their favorite coffee brand and explains what they like about it, or a YouTuber films themselves unboxing a product and showing off its features, UGC highlights the visual. It gives a potential buyer a close-up, unfiltered look at the product or service.</p> <h3>03. Highly affordable and effective</h3> <p>User-generated content won’t break the bank. Rather than pouring your social media marketing budget into creating ads, your users do it for you. Unless you offer sponsorship in exchange for content, organic user-generated content doesn’t cost a brand anything. </p> <p>Given this fact, user generated content can produce a high return on investment (ROI). Asking clients to share free content online can result in increased brand awareness for your business, influencing audiences that haven’t yet converted. </p> <h3>04. Inspires brand loyalty</h3> <p>While many established brands like Coca-Cola, Starbucks and GoPro have elevated their marketing campaigns with user-generated content, newer and smaller brands can also find this strategy particularly helpful. User-generated content’s community-oriented nature can help you build up your fan base and connect with consumers. Instead of interacting with your brand from the distance of email campaigns, audiences will engage with other real customers who have tried and tested your brand. </p> <p>These long-term relationships also encourage repeat sales. Through sharing content that supports your brand, they become loyal advocates for your business.</p> <h2>How to incorporate user-generated content into your marketing strategy</h2> <p>Once you’ve inspired users to generate buzz around your brand, leverage it with your own <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/02/content-strategy/" target="_blank" >content strategy</a>. </p> <h3>First, determine your goal</h3> <p>Before you start asking your customers for user-generated content, assess your ultimate goals to understand the best route to success. You may want to:</p> <ul> <li>Create brand awareness</li> <li>Increase social engagement</li> <li>Cut down on marketing costs </li> <li>Establish trust and credibility</li> <li>Listen to users </li> </ul> <p>Once you decide your goals for user-generated content, you'll decide details like which social network will be most effective or which content you’ll request from your audience.</p> <h3>Encourage reviews and content</h3> <p>When creating a UGC-based marketing campaign, make sure you know what you want. </p> <p>To host a contest that requires content creation as an entry, write out clear instructions for your audience. If you want to create a hashtag that your community can use to show off their purchases, make sure to show them an example of the images or videos you’d like to see paired with the hashtag. The more specific, the better.</p> <p>Give these campaigns time to grow. Just because you asked for content today doesn’t mean it’ll happen right away. These campaigns often have a snowball effect.</p> <h3>Create a user-generated content library</h3> <p>Once you’ve launched your campaign and amassed a good amount of user posts, try creating a content library for future use. You can either save users’ posts to use in your future Instagram marketing campaigns or just for when you need to fill out your feed. Many users love seeing their posts on brand pages, so once your campaign finishes, you can still use the content.</p> <h2>Best practices for sharing user-generated content</h2> <p>While you can be creative in your user-generated content campaign, follow these general guidelines: </p> <h3>Search on social media</h3> <p>Before you begin a campaign, search on social platforms to see what user-generated content already exists. Generate authentic <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2017/10/content-ideas-for-blogs-and-websites/" target="_blank" >content ideas</a> from there. For example, you can look up hashtags on Instagram that relate to your brand or include your brand name, search for reviews online and look at Twitter mentions of your brand.</p> <h3>Ask permission and give credit</h3> <p>Before you repost a user’s content, always ask for permission. When you do repost, always tag the creator or mention them in a caption.</p> <h3>Showcase elsewhere</h3> <p>Just because a lot of user-generated content stems from social media, it doesn’t need to stay there. Use your audience’s posts in promotional content on your website.</p> <h3>Incentivize content</h3><p>Encourage users to share content by giving them something in return. You can offer them a repost or share, a grand prize giveaway or a discount on future purchases. Be clear about your offer so users know what to expect.</p> <h3>Maintain your brand identity and voice</h3> <p>When you source content from different people and accounts, using it while keeping your brand’s voice or visual aesthetic intact can be tricky. You don’t need to reshare everything you receive. Instead, highlight the content that fits your brand and marketing style.</p> <h2>Examples of user-generated content to inspire your next campaign</h2> <p>You can do a lot with creative user-generated content. Perhaps the best way to get inspiration for your next campaign is to browse through successful <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/10/content-marketing-examples/" target="_blank" >content marketing examples</a> from the past few years. Learn from these user-generated content examples below—but remember to add your own spin on things to make your brand stand out among the rest.</p> <h3>Review content</h3> <p><a href="https://www.hm.com/" target="_blank" >H&M</a> does a good job of inspiring its customers to leave reviews and create visual content for the clothing brand. On its website, visitors will find written reviews about each clothing item. H&M encourages its shoppers to leave these reviews by offering points, which they can redeem as cash on a future purchase.</p> <p>Alongside the product page and the reviews, H&M also features a “Styled by you” section which shows off user-generated content from social media demonstrating how everyday shoppers wore their pieces. This gives shoppers a solid idea of what to expect when purchasing and makes them feel like they can trust H&M.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ea6ac8_ef8fd03f92fa42eb86c638f2d1818531~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_583,al_c,q_80/file.png" title="H&M Website's review page" alt="Screenshot of H&M website customer review page where customers review their products as an example of user generated content"></figure><h3>Hashtag campaigns</h3> <p>In 2014, Starbucks launched the White Cup Contest, encouraging its fanbase to design the next special-edition Starbucks coffee cup. The brand asked its customers to put their own design on a blank cup, snap a picture of it and upload it to Twitter or Instagram with the hashtag #WhiteCupContest.</p> <p>The contest was born when the brand’s marketers searched through social media posts to see what customers already doodled on its white cups. Then Starbucks decided to take it one step further. The White Cup Contest resulted in thousands of creative and engaging entries from around the world. </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ea6ac8_c3ea546efeea48f1ab5f918a7ef5a089~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_583,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="instagram post by user &quot;zen inspired designs&quot; whose image is shown as part of starbuck's hashtag contest &quot;#white cup contest&quot; which is an example of user generated content"></figure><h3>Video content</h3> <p>Video content works well across social channels, like Instagram, Twitter and Facebook, where users can upload stories, posts or reels to promote a brand. User-generated video content prevails on YouTube. In fact, some YouTuber dedicate their entire channels to uploading video product reviews.</p> <p>In the video below, a YouTube vlogger receives a subscription box from FabFitFun. As she goes through each item one-by-one, she explains to viewers how FabFitFun’s subscription works and offers a discount code to encourage sign-ups.</p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul6E9fYmRew">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul6E9fYmRew</a><h3>Social media account takeovers</h3> <p>Takeovers can effectively integrate new voices into your brand’s social media pages while promoting user-generated content. In a page takeover, users will log on to your social pages to share their own posts, stories or live feed. Users will get creative freedom and a new audience to connect with, and you’ll get new and engaging content for your followers. </p> <p>Weight Watchers hosted a series of Instagram takeovers featuring program members who spent a day talking about their experience with the weight-loss program. They shared stories, recipes and tips with the entire Weight Watchers community on Instagram, offering support and establishing brand trust.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ea6ac8_416f45d2ab3242309a55a615372219b3~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_583,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="screenshot of Weight Watcher's Instagram feed featuring members who participate in Instagram takeovers for the brand. this is another example of user generated content. "></figure><h3>Influencer partnerships</h3> <p>When working with <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2019/08/what-is-influencer-marketing/" target="_blank" >influencer marketing</a>, creators will generally ask for payment beyond a sponsored item. But if they have a high (100,000+) number of engaged followers, the cost is worth the price. However, many people view this type of UGC content as less authentic, since they know the brand paid the influencer to post.</p> <p>The watch brand Daniel Wellington frequently works with Instagram influencers to promote its products and expose the brand to new audiences. Since they frequently work with influencers, the brand has a near-endless source of photos to choose from.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ea6ac8_a264b467446746f287c9c2916cbdd711~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_583,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="Screenshot of influencer &quot;Mumu And Macaroons&quot; wearing a watch by designer Daniel Wellington. The text corresponding the image in the post states that this is a partnership between the influencer and the brand Daniel Wellington, which is an example of user generated content."></figure><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ea6ac8_c6efe79322ef4324a7f6b8daab5bcb15~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_60,h_60,al_c,q_80/file.png" ></figure><p><strong>By Jenna Romano</strong></p> <p>Web Design Expert, Blog Writer</p> ]]>

Content is everywhere."></figure> <p><em>This post was updated on November 18, 2022.</em></p> <p>​​</p> <p>In an endless sea of information, standing out might seem impossible. But an effective content strategy can help you rise above the noise and reach the right people. Whether your business is just starting out or you want to revamp your existing content marketing efforts, you can find ways to make your strategy more efficient. In this article, we’ll define content strategy, then go over the basics of developing one.</p> <p>Whether you decide to <a href="https://www.wix.com/start/blog" target="_blank" >create a blog</a> or start a podcast, a website is key to every content strategy. Use Wix to <a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank" >create a website</a> and connect all your content in one place.</p> <h2>What is a content strategy?</h2> <p><a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2020/04/what-is-content-marketing/" target="_blank" >Content marketing</a> is the practice of distributing valuable information to your target market. To optimize its performance, you need a content strategy. A content strategy is your plan for creating, monitoring and managing content. It should determine your goals, target market and priority formats, plus how your content will support your brand. A content strategy should also include promotional plans and set metrics to determine your content’s success. </p> <h2>How to create a content strategy</h2> <p>Follow these steps to create an effective content strategy:</p> <ol> <li>Determine your target audience</li> <li>Define your goals </li> <li>Perform market research</li> <li>Choose your distribution channels</li> <li>Set your KPIs</li> <li>Decide what type of content to create</li> <li>Create a content calendar</li> <li>Analyze the data</li> <li>Reassess your strategy</li> </ol> <h3>01. Determine your target audience</h3> <p>To tailor your content strategy plan, you need to first determine who you want your content to reach. For example, how old are they? What is important to them? What problems do they face in their day-to-day lives? Once you have a sense of their demographics and psychographics (which refers to more internal attributes such as interests and lifestyles), you can start figuring out what content they'll find valuable and interesting.</p> <h3>02. Define your goals</h3> <p>An effective <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2020/04/what-is-content-marketing/" target="_blank" >content marketing</a> strategy will include both actionable long-term and short-term goals that can translate into clear tasks with measurable outcomes. </p> <p>Brand awareness, for example, is a great goal for new businesses. Before you begin making sales, your customers need to find out about you. Business often achieve brand awareness on social platforms, so part of your marketing strategy could include creating a detailed social media calendar and creating content that will spark interest, foster engagement and improve your brand’s visibility. </p> <p>Once your content strategy plan has driven traffic to your website and social channels, you’ll next want to convert your leads into customers. You may want to include calls-to-action in your content or send out a newsletter to keep your leads engaged with your business. </p> <p>Consider these other content strategy goals as well:</p> <ul> <li>Elevate your brand</li> <li>Increase your revenue</li> <li>Retain your customers</li> <li>Attract talent</li> <li>Improve customer service</li> <li>Rebrand your company</li> </ul> <p>Ensure that each piece of content you release has a distinct purpose in your content strategy to move you closer to your goal. To do this, define SMART goals (goals that are “specific,” “measurable,” “attainable,” “relevant,” and “time-bound.”) </p> <h3>03. Perform market research</h3> <p>You should also research what your competition does with their content. If your competition performs well on search engines, use tools like SimilarWeb, Ahrefs or Semrush to find out which keywords they rank for and get a sense of their strategy. </p> <p>In addition to finding out what your competition gets right with their content strategy, look for gaps in their content that you can fill. If they have a weaker social media presence compared to their organic search strategy, you might consider developing your strategy around social media. </p> <h3>04. Choose your distribution channels</h3> <p>Develop one or two promising—and ideally complementary—channels. For example, a blog can work well with a Facebook or Instagram page, since you can build an audience and share your content on these platforms. </p> <p>According to Hubspot, 10% of marketers believe that a blog content strategy has the <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbusiness-blogging-in-2015&#38;hubs_post-cta=13-times%20the%20ROI&#38;_ga=2.108476609.2130131778.1663175396-939801692.1663175396" target="_blank" >biggest return on investment</a> of all marketing strategies. However, Wix’s Head of Blogs Growth Judit Ruiz Ricart warns blogs can take years of investment before seeing returns. She suggests focusing on your website’s SEO and acquisition, then using social media to build brand awareness and a newsletter to keep interested parties in your network.</p> <p>Tip: If you’ve picked Google as your main distribution channel, check out the <a href="https://www.wix.com/seo/learn" target="_blank" >Wix SEO Learning Hub</a> and <a href="https://www.wix.com/seo" target="_blank" >Wix’s SEO</a> tools.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_becf7097e26a4a97b7614a4c174d93a0~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_909,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="Wix uses its Instagram as a distribution platform for its content marketing strategy."></figure> <h3>05. Set your KPIs </h3> <p>Once you set your goals, set key performance indicators (KPIs) that determine if your content and distribution methods work. How will you measure your content marketing efforts’ return on investment? If, for example, you want to increase brand awareness, you wouldn’t make your KPI conversions. Instead, you would monitor website traffic or social media engagement. </p> <p>KPIs set expectations and ensure that you efficiently work toward your goals. You could use these KPIs to measure your content marketing performance:</p> <ul> <li>Traffic</li> <li>Conversion rate</li> <li>Engagement</li> <li>Number of ranking keywords</li> <li>Organic visibility percentage</li> <li>Qualified leads</li> <li>Revenue</li> </ul> <h3>06. Decide what type of content to create</h3> <p>Content marketing includes more than blog posts, landing pages, guides and <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2019/08/how-to-create-webinar/" target="_blank" >webinars</a>. You could also try memes, surveys, data visualizations, company news and contests. Let’s talk about nine useful types of content marketing and why you should include them in your content strategy plan:</p> <ul> <li>Ebooks: Like blogs, e-books provide helpful tips or relevant insights from your business. In addition to the value they offer existing customers, ebooks can attract leads. By “gating” an ebook, you can incentivize your target market to share their contact information or subscribe to your newsletter in exchange for your content. </li> </ul><ul> <li>Infographics: You can repurpose your data-heavy, long-form content into infographics. Provide the key takeaways in a concise visual representation to create eye-catching and shareable content. </li> </ul><ul> <li>Case studies: When you tell potential customers about the positive experiences your existing customers had working with your business, you offer them a reason to trust you. You can produce case studies in various formats such as blog posts or videos.</li> </ul><ul> <li>Free tools: Ross Simmonds, founder of Foundation Marketing, explained in an email to Wix’s content team that free tools are some of his favorite content marketing assets and that many marketers overlook them. Unlike a blog that requires consistent investment, tools like checklists, templates, calculators and generators (like Wix's <a href="https://www.wix.com/tools/business-name-generator" target="_blank" >business name generator</a>, for example) are effective for years, often without much upkeep. </li> </ul><ul> <li>Videos: According to Hubspot, marketers see <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/hubfs/2022_State-of-Inbound-Marketing-Trends_V08122022.pdf" target="_blank" >videos as the most popular form of content marketing</a> as they’re highly engaging and shareable. Marketers believe that short-form videos—such as TikToks and Instagram Reels—and live streaming have the highest ROI. Use the Wix <a href="https://www.wix.com/tools/video-maker" target="_blank" >video maker</a> to simplify the production process.</li> </ul><ul> <li>Market reports: Show off your industry knowledge with market reports to generate leads.</li> </ul><ul> <li>Podcasts: Ruiz Ricart recommends working podcasts into your content strategy plan because you can start them easily and they organically attract listeners.</li> </ul><ul> <li>White papers: White papers are extensive reports that share research and data.</li> </ul><ul> <li>Testimonials: <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2011/02/what-is-ugc-and-why-your-site-needs-it/" target="_blank" >User-generated content</a> is invaluable—especially when working on a budget. Share quotes from reviews, social media comments and heartfelt emails from overjoyed customers on your website or social media channels.</li> </ul> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_4691838eec814d7eae6817f79176bc4a~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_528,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="A website called Onyx, which uses podcasts in its content marketing strategy."></figure> <h3>07. Create a content calendar</h3> <p>When it comes to actually creating and distributing content, many people will enthusiastically publish content they consider good quality without considering whether it stays true to their strategy. A content calendar can solve this issue.</p> <p>Creating an editorial calendar will help you plan out your content for important events like product launches and <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2014/12/online-content-for-holiday-season/" target="_blank" >holiday content marketing</a>. It also helps you stay consistent with your publishing and distribution cadence. Eventually, you’ll develop a rhythm that your audience will notice and they’ll begin to expect content from your business on regular intervals. </p> <p>Developing an editorial calendar in advance can also help you plan your resources and set tasks for your team. Creating content and posting on multiple channels every day can overwhelm a small team. With a content calendar, you can manage expectations and also anticipate any additional resources or marketing tools your team might need.</p> <h3>08. Analyze the data</h3> <p>Data analysis helps you determine how well your content performs, identify strategic areas to improve and monitor your target audience. Platforms such as Google, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram have integrated analytics systems. Additionally, <a href="https://www.wix.com/manage/analytics" target="_blank" >Wix Analytics</a> can tell you where your website traffic comes from as well as how people move through your site.</p> <p>Aside from determining success via metrics, you should also speak and listen to your customers. Pay attention to how they interact with your content on social media and listen to the feedback they communicate in reviews, comments or questions on your blog posts. Often, your customers will tell you exactly what they like and don’t like.</p> <h3>09. Reassess your strategy</h3> <p>While your content strategy’s end goal remains the same, the implementation is a cyclic process. Ruiz Ricart says that you have to restart or build upon your methods every six months: You set a small goal, choose the metrics that’ll measure your performance and create content you think will help you achieve those goals. Then, you analyze the data and set new goals for how you can improve or expand your content. You measure the performance on the new content and keep building upon your goals and your strategy until you can comprehensively cover your entire customer journey. </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_c21216d3ee1b482db2901777165d13ab~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_710,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="How to create a content strategy: 1. Determine your target audience 2. Define your goals 3. Perform market research 4. Choose your distribution channels 5. Set your KPIs 6. Decide what type of content to create 7. Create a content calendar 8. Analyze the data 9. Reassess your strategy"></figure><h2>4 best practices for creating meaningful content</h2> <p>As you move through the content marketing strategy process, keep these important things in mind: </p> <h3>Start small</h3> <p>Don’t build upon your strategy until you have a steady foundation. Start with very small, clear goals and set the metrics to measure them. Then, use that data to improve and test something new.</p> <h3>Be realistic</h3> <p>You should define your strategy by the time, money and resources you can invest. You won’t achieve anything if you spread yourself too thin. Tailor your approach to have a substantial impact. “Know what your resources are, know what you want to achieve in the short-term, then see what’s the best platform to allow you to do that,” said Ruiz Ricart. </p> <h3>Prioritize quality over quantity</h3> <p>According to a survey of marketers, 83% believe it’s more effective to create fewer pieces of <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/hubfs/2022_State-of-Inbound-Marketing-Trends_V08122022.pdf" target="_blank" >higher-quality content</a> than lower-quality content more often.</p> <h3>Be nimble</h3> <p>A good content strategy plan is adaptable. If you focus on Instagram and find out the platform prioritizes Reels, you need to focus on Reels. If you notice that your Stories perform well, you pivot your strategy to invest more in Stories.</p> <p>You might even find that your goals change. For example, most new businesses want to generate brand awareness. After the business achieves the necessary level of market penetration, it can adapt its content strategy to get more leads, encourage more purchases or increase brand loyalty.</p> <h2>3 content strategy examples</h2> <p>Looking for some inspiration? Learn from these <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/10/content-marketing-examples/" target="_blank" >content marketing examples</a>:</p> <h3>Wix</h3> <p>Over the years, Wix has developed a content strategy that spans the entire customer journey, with teams focused on creating the content customers need to progress through the marketing funnel. “Every single stage needs a very specific strategy,” explained Ruiz Ricart. </p> <p>With traffic as the primary KPI, the Wix Blog uses SEO to increase domain strength and brand awareness. Wix’s social media accounts are dedicated to brand elevation, with engagement as its KPIs. Landing pages are the primary conversion content, so the KPI is the conversion rate. <a href="https://www.wix.com/learn" target="_blank" >Wix Learn</a> (a learning platform that features webinars, tutorials and courses) is dedicated to nurturing and retaining customers. Finally, our newsletters focus on getting users to invest more in the products.</p> <h3>Ahrefs</h3> <p>Ahref’s provides informative blog posts as part of their content strategy. The content team markets an SEO tool, and they effectively rank on many relevant search engine results pages. But their articles focus on educating readers about their product, indicating a KPI in conversion or customer retention. Additionally, the Ahrefs marketing team spreads out their investment across a series of webinars, a strong YouTube channel, an engaging newsletter and a landing page for a beginner’s guide to SEO.</p> <h3>Animalz</h3> <p>Animalz, a content strategy agency with a fantastic blog, relies exclusively on direct traffic—a rarity in content marketing. They aim to sell through their thought leadership, and exemplify what can happen when you allow your content strategy to evolve as it grows. “I’m sure they didn’t start like that,” said Ruiz Ricart. “There’s no way the Animalz owner woke up one day and said, ‘I’m gonna write this amazing piece, people are gonna love it and they’re gonna come to us directly.’”</p> <p>They merely did what they knew how to do: Create content. The lesson here is to rely on your skills. If you’re a real estate agent who knows how to read the market, write an accessible newsletter for the average person who doesn’t want to buy unless the price is right. If you’re witty, try meme marketing. If you’re a wedding photographer, make dreamy slideshows to share on social media. </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_2a0d09728dba463da9d4f62042fa084a~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_60,h_60,al_c,q_80/file.png" ></figure><p>By Emily Shwake</p> <p>Wix Blog Writer</p> ]]>

Just as when you <a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank" >create a website</a>, you must know what works with TikTok’s audience if you want to build your brand and gain customers from the platform. </p> <p>If you want to know what a successful TikTok branding strategy looks like, keep reading. In this post, we’ll go into what TikTok marketing is, why brands find it a useful <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/06/types-of-marketing/" target="_blank" >type of marketing</a> (with examples) and how to get your business up and running.</p> <h2>What is TikTok marketing?</h2> <p>If you haven't figured out <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2020/07/what-is-tik-tok/" target="_blank" >what is TikTok</a> yet, we'll make it easy: TikTok is a video hosting app that launched in 2017. Users can access it via their web browser, a desktop app or a mobile app. </p> <p>Unlike a platform like YouTube, TikTok highlights short-form videos of anywhere from 15 seconds to 3 minutes long. </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_eaa9251e171d4298a507e0bbfd6031c6~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_528,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="Wix's TikTok marketing account."></figure> <p>TikTok marketing appeals to businesses and entrepreneurs alike who may be short on time (and funds) but want their <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/12/marketing-strategies/" target="_blank" >marketing strategies</a> to make a big impact. </p> <p>Although prank and dance videos may often go viral on TikTok, other content does well there, too. And companies have achieved success far beyond occasional virality. TikTok creator Mario Moreno told <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90746981/tiktok-social-video" target="_blank" ><em>Fast Company</em></a>:</p> <p>“TikTok is so much more than social media. It is a place where creators inspire, educate or entertain. There are so many sub-categories within TikTok and the view time illustrates that people are on the platform consuming content not from a social standpoint but an entertainment and discovery standpoint.”</p> <p>Your content will unlock your success in TikTok marketing. Videos related to entertainment, fitness and sports, DIY, beauty, cooking, life hacks, and perform really well there. Small business owners and entrepreneurs can use this knowledge to devise a winning video marketing strategy for their unique brands.</p> <h2>Why is TikTok an effective marketing tool?</h2> <p>According to a recent <a href="https://helloalice.com/blog/small-business-digital-marketing-trends-2022/" target="_blank" >Hello Alice Research Report</a>, 51% of small-to-medium-sized businesses find TikTok allows them to organically reach their audience (not far behind Facebook and Instagram). </p> <p>Like other <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/12/marketing-trends/" target="_blank" >marketing trends</a>, TikTok marketing can do more than just boost brand awareness and bring more leads to your brand. SMBs said it also helped them to:</p> <ul> <li>Hire new employees</li> <li>Open new locations</li> <li>Grow revenue</li> <li>Raise capital</li> <li>Safeguard their business against the pandemic’s effects</li> </ul> <p>What exactly makes TikTok such a useful marketing tool? For starters, analysts project TikTok will have <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tik-tok-statistics/" target="_blank" >1.8 billion active users every month</a> by the end of 2022. These users live all over the world, too—China, the United States, Indonesia, Brazil, etc.</p> <p>They also spend a lot of time and money on the app. </p> <p>According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/195140/new-user-generated-content-uploaded-by-users-per-minute/" target="_blank" >Statista</a>, TikTok users watched 167 million videos every minute in 2021. What’s more, users spend an average of 52 minutes inside the app every day, according to <a href="https://backlinko.com/tiktok-users" target="_blank" >Backlinko</a>.</p> <p>All that time equates to a lot of money. In just Q4 of 2021, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1285432/tiktok-worldwide-quarterly-consumer-spend/" target="_blank" >TikTok users spent $824 million</a> via the Google Play and Apple app stores. </p> <p>Brands that devise an effective TikTok branding and marketing strategy can gain a very engaged and spendy audience. Brands can find marketing success beyond video creation there, though.</p> <h2>3 types of TikTok marketing</h2> <p>You can use TikTok in your brand and marketing strategy in three ways:</p> <h3>01. Create TikTok campaigns</h3> <p>You can become a creator—either through your personal TikTok account or you can set up a business account.</p> <p>TikTok videos let you market your brand the best way you see fit. For instance, eCommerce businesses and small local retailers might find it beneficial to film product unboxing videos. This would allow you to let people see how your products look and work in real time. If your brand provides services on the other hand, then you or your team may end up starring in your videos. </p> <p>You can go in so many directions with TikTok content creation. Brands bring attention to themselves in interesting ways that other platforms haven’t allowed them to.</p> <h3>02. Partner with an influencer</h3> <p>Brands of all sizes will find TikTok influencer marketing useful. Focus on finding an influencer that your target audience will recognize and who makes sense for your business. </p> <p>Don’t stress if you can’t invest in influencers like Addison Rae. The right micro-influencers can impact your business just as much—if not more than high-profile figures. </p> <p>In addition, if you’re an influencer yourself, you can find retail brands to partner with. </p> <h3>03. Run ads</h3> <p>TikTok ads work similarly to advertising on other social media platforms. A bidding model determines ad cost, so the more specific you get about your ad goals and target audience, the better.</p> <p>That said, while TikTok advertising offers a variety of ad spots, they don’t come cheap.</p> <p>According to <a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/how-much-do-tiktok-ads-cost/" target="_blank" >Influencer Marketing Hub</a>, an ad costs $10 per CPM. In addition, you have to spend a minimum of $500 on every campaign you run. </p> <p>Half of the small businesses surveyed by Hello Alice said that TikTok allowed them to organically reach their audience. Considering the high cost of advertising, start with organic (i.e. free) video creation first when figuring out <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/02/how-to-make-money-on-tiktok/" target="_blank" >how to make money on TikTok</a> with your target audience.</p> <h2>Awesome TikTok brand examples</h2> <p>TikTok has an audience of almost two billion users. As you can imagine, many brands and entrepreneurs are attempting to get in on the action. </p> <p>Some recent standouts include:</p> <h3>BarkBox</h3> <p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@barkbox" target="_blank" >@barkbox</a>: While the dogs care about the treats and toys they get from their monthly subscription service, their owners care more about the content that BarkBox creates—like videos that introduce them to all the office dogs or that show off rejected BarkBox toy ideas.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_72b48b9db95a4e48a6b00a79abdb5ee0~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_725,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="A post from BarkBox's TikTok marketing account."></figure> <h3>James Lewis</h3> <p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jamesllewis" target="_blank" >@jamesllewis</a>: This artist publishes real-time videos of his creations via TikTok. He invites his followers to <a href="https://www.jamesllewis.com/links" target="_blank" >his website</a> where he teaches workshops and sells art gear.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_c371de5c82454d8b8d4106150d87ebf1~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_725,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="A post from James Lewis's TikTok marketing account."></figure> <h3>Nicky Cass</h3> <p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nicky.cass1?lang=en" target="_blank" >@nicky.cass1</a>: This social media influencer creates comedic content that riffs on Italian American life. In addition to posting original content to his channel on a regular basis, he finds funny ways to integrate his affiliate partners into his skits.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_401565bb02fa423cbaface40e04889ad~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_725,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="A post from Nicky Cass's TikTok marketing account."></figure> <h3>Peachybbies Slime</h3> <p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@peachyslime" target="_blank" >@peachyslime</a> makes and sells colorful and sparkly slimes. Rather than use her channel to actively push her products, she often answers questions from followers while demonstrating her hands-on techniques.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_415d33b962de497484ad0ccd843ba0bb~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_725,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="A post from PeachyBbies Slime's TikTok marketing account."></figure> <h3>Planet Fitness</h3> <p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@planetfitness" target="_blank" >@planetfitness</a> uses TikTok to put out humorous videos about working out. It shows off the brand’s personality while reinforcing the idea that exercise can be fun and you can joke about it, too.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_17a007ebb6bd4a10b075fe73bc6d3fdc~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_725,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="A post from Planet Fitness's TikTok marketing account."></figure> <h3>Dareen Keefe</h3> <p>You may already recognize <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thedancingcarpenter" target="_blank" >@thedancingcarpenter</a> from HGTV’s Extreme Makeover. He uses his platform on TikTok to share lighthearted videos of him dancing in his workshop while promoting his carpentry work.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_15c8ea1575b9445daa9aa9b51bef8b7c~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_725,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="A post from Dareen Keefe's TikTok marketing account."></figure> <h3>The Washington Post</h3> <p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@washingtonpost" target="_blank" >@washingtonpost</a>: This Washington D.C.-based daily newspaper uses its TikTok channel to post video highlights from the week’s news. It also occasionally shares posts that add a comedic touch to its commentary.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_647b85b72c7e44d391eaf653313f186a~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_725,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="A post from The Washington Post's TikTok marketing account."></figure> <h3>Wix</h3> <p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wix" target="_blank" >@wix</a>: Full of trendy songs, funny voice-overs, and retro effects, Wix users will find the website creation brand’s TikTok channel engaging. It also happens to frequently promote useful information for small business owners and entrepreneurs wanting to make headway online.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_ec25d68005174aa28f96ca16fb6f1258~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_725,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="A post from Wix's TikTok marketing account."></figure> <h2>How to open a TikTok account for your business</h2> <p>While you don’t need to create a business account to use TikTok, you’ll miss out on all the tools offered to brands. For example:</p> <ul> <li>Analytics</li> <li>Creator portal </li> <li>Q&A forum</li> <li>Informational guides</li> <li>TikTok creator marketplace (to find influencer partnerships)</li> </ul> <p>Setting up a TikTok account for your business is easy. If you change your mind, you can easily switch back to a personal account.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> If you don’t yet have a TikTok account: Create one. </p> <p>Go to TikTok.com and click the Log in button. This will open a pop-up with login options. </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_7ee3c59f7a4141668b0960258406ca7a~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_725,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="The TikTok login page."></figure> <p>If you have an account, choose the corresponding login option. If you don’t, look for a Sign up link at the bottom and click it.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_0b14dada85674f929cbef972493b0357~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_725,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="The signup page for TikTok."></figure> <p>Sign up with your email address, phone number or use your Facebook, Google, or Twitter account. </p> <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Fill in the basic details for your account.</p> <p>Create an account name—this name will sit atop your page, like “<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jackinthebox" target="_blank" >Jack in the Box</a>” does in the example here:</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_e5ea49d3310f4ed3a77a63d07fde8e03~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_725,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="Jack in the Box's TikTok marketing account."></figure> <p>Also come up with an account handle (like @jackinthebox). It probably won’t match your account name since you can’t include any spaces and TikTok limits how many characters you can use.</p> <p>Lastly, upload a photo or logo to represent your brand.</p> <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Click on the three dots in the top-right corner of your account page screen and go to Manage account.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_670b3eba01de4c4d884619356a4f94fd~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_725,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="The page on TikTok where you can manage your account."></figure> <p>Click on Switch to Business Account. A pop-up will appear, telling you about the benefits of using <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/06/tiktok-for-business/" target="_blank" >TikTok for business</a>. (By the way, if you ever want to switch back to Personal, you’ll do it here.) Click the Next button.</p> <p>In the next screen, choose a category that best fits your business type:</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_37e4d4c6a4274a0da6d1c11e113ff074~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_725,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="The page in the TikTok for business signup process where you choose a category that fits your business."></figure> <p>When finished, you’ll return to your account page. </p> <p>You can now add a bio as well as a link to your page. Use the link to direct followers and other TikTok users back to your website. You could also use it to promote a curated linktree, like those offered by <a href="https://www.hopp.co/" target="_blank" >Hopp.co</a>.</p> <h2>8 tips for creating your TikTok marketing strategy</h2> <p>If you want a big return on your <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2018/11/social-media-marketing" target="_blank" >social media marketing</a> investment, then you must strategize first. </p> <p>Use these tips to craft your TikTok marketing and branding strategy: </p> <h3>01. Know your audience</h3> <p>First, get acquainted with who uses TikTok. According to <a href="https://datareportal.com/essential-tiktok-stats" target="_blank" >DataReportal</a>, 56.2% of TikTok users are female. Each day, the ratio of females to males shrinks, though.</p> <p>TikTok also has an international audience. Of its almost two billion monthly users, only about 140 million live in the United States. </p> <p>In addition, TikTok users tend to be younger. According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1095186/tiktok-us-users-age/" target="_blank" >Statista</a>, the age demographics break down as such:</p> <ul> <li>25% are 10-19</li> <li>22.4% are 20-29</li> <li>21.7% are 30-39</li> <li>20.3% are 40-49</li> <li>11% are 50+</li> </ul> <p>If you want to tap into a broad range of TikTok users, this information will help you decide if your brand’s target audience even uses the platform.</p> <h3>02. Stalk the competition</h3> <p>Find out if your competition already uses TikTok—many brands haven’t jumped on the relatively young platform yet.</p> <p>If you do find competition there, spend some time perusing their content.</p> <p> </p><ul> <li>What videos do they create? </li> <li>Subjectively, do you think they do a good job? </li> <li>Objectively, do they receive a positive response in terms of views, likes and comments?</li> </ul> <p>Also, take a look at the pages of their most engaging followers. This will help you learn more about the people who might want to follow you on TikTok.</p> <p> </p> <h3>03. Follow the trends</h3> <p>If you spend enough time on TikTok, you’ll quickly notice what trends: In some cases, it’s a background song, sound or voice-over. In other cases, the video’s content catches on—like a particular dance routine or a social media challenge.</p> <p>Hopping on a trend doesn’t guarantee your account will go viral. Instead, brush up on trends so you can sense what gets users excited. Even if the trend doesn’t fit with your brand’s personality, it may inspire an inventive variation.</p> <h3>04. Carve out your own path</h3> <p>Speaking of originality, you’ll find the most TikTok marketing success if you stay authentic. </p> <p>It may take some time to figure out how to best present your brand’s uniqueness through video. Don’t be afraid to test out different content strategies. </p> <p>Are you and your team members particularly funny? If so, will your particular brand of humor play well to the TikTok audience?</p> <p>Will people find your brand’s behind-the-scenes as interesting as what you produce? Can you capture it on video in an innovative and exciting way?</p> <p>Do you have a talent for making social media videos? If you have experience on a platform like Instagram that allows you to play with music, filters and emoji, then you may find success jazzing up otherwise regular posts. </p> <h3>05. Use a video editor</h3> <p>Although you can use TikTok’s app to film videos and import images, you’ll likely find it easier to create your content within a platform-specific tool.</p> <p>With TikTok’s free video maker, you can:</p> <ul> <li>Import content from the media library or stock photo websites (in case you don’t have your own to start with).</li> <li>Embed your logo as a watermark or to reinforce branding.</li> <li>Choose from a pre-made theme and special effects (like glitch, pixels or duotone).</li> <li>Apply a custom color palette and font style to all your videos.</li> </ul> <p>While you can use the video maker to add text overlays to your content, save music for inside the app to make sure that your content plays without issue.</p> <h3>06. Create a schedule</h3> <p>The more consistently you publish TikTok videos, the more engagement you’ll get. Users want to follow TikTok brands that regularly create new, interesting content. </p> <p>As you plot out what content you’ll create, also think about how frequently you’ll film and when is the best time to post on TikTok to engage with your followers. You may want to set aside a day every week to create and schedule out a batch of videos. That way, you won’t have to scramble to publish a video to meet people’s expectations. Plus, if you get in the creation habit, you’ll think about it more, which will simplify your content brainstorming.</p> <h3>07. Engage with your followers and other accounts</h3> <p>Successful brands use social media to build communities and engage with them. So start following other accounts that you personally enjoy or operate in the same industry.</p> <p>Then, start engaging with their content. Start putting your brand (and personal) account name out there. Like their posts, comment on them and get to know other TikTok users. All the while, work on creating your own content. </p> <p>As your engagement on the platform grows, users will naturally want to know who responds and will make their way to your page. An account full of innovative content for them to check out will help you get followers on TikTok. </p> <h3>08. Monitor your analytics</h3> <p>As a brand, TikTok will give you access to analytics so you can monitor your account’s performance. </p> <p>Before you start checking in on your analytics, though, set some goals for yourself:</p> <ul> <li>How many new users do you want each month?</li> <li>How many likes should your posts get?</li> <li>What about comments and shares?</li> <li>How many people would you like to click on the link in your bio?</li> </ul> <p>If you know what you want from TikTok, then you’ll find your analytics more meaningful and useful. For instance, if people don’t click on your bio link, then this might suggest that you need to mention it more in your posts. </p> <h3>Pro tip: Use the right hashtags</h3> <p>TikTok hashtags (#) aren’t just a list of words you throw on the end of the post. Hashtags can help you accomplish many of your brand goals. </p> <p>For one, hashtags can surprise your visitors with an extra dose of humor or personality when they least expect it. They can also subtly provide more context to your video.</p> <p>Also, hashtags can help new users find your content. You don’t need to use trending hashtags and compete with millions of other posts. In fact, that might make it harder for your target audience to find your content. </p> <p>In addition, using the same hashtags to reinforce your branding and certain labels associated with your brand can tell TikTok’s search algorithm more about your account. This will help the search engine place your account and posts in relevant results. </p> <p>Lastly, you can use hashtags as a challenge to your users. Do something in one of your videos and then challenge your followers to do the same thing. If they take on that challenge, give them a branded hashtag to use so that you know they participated. Not only can you build a community around your brand, but you’ll have free user-generated content that you can share on your account page. </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_2a0d09728dba463da9d4f62042fa084a~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_60,h_60,al_c,q_80/file.png" ></figure><p>By Emily Shwake</p> <p>Wix Blog Writer</p> ]]>

And just like the rest of the online world, your site should evolve and change over time, staying as fresh as the service or product you provide.</p> <p>A big part of<a href="https://www.wix.com/website/design" target="_blank" > designing a website</a> is everything that happens after pressing the ‘publish’ button—from ongoing updates and tweaks, to promotion across different channels. Yet, after a certain period of time, you'll find you require a more encompassing website redesign.</p> <p>In this article, we will cover everything you need to know about redesigning a website and if it’s time to change yours. </p> <h2>What is website redesign?</h2> <p>Website redesign is a basic part of <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/08/website-maintenance/" target="_blank" >website maintenance</a>. Effective redesign improves both a website’s functionality, as well as its looks. A redesign should therefore address a site’s content, user experience, SEO practices and mobile optimization, alongside its <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/05/web-design/" target="_blank" >web design</a>.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/72c0b2_7264351118fd4dc09e07847d6bff7c86~mv2.gif/v1/fit/w_925,h_474,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="Website redesign"></figure> <h2>Website redesign vs. website refresh</h2> <p>Understanding the difference between a refresh and a complete overhaul mostly relates to the project scale. For example, a simple update to your website’s color palette, typography or subtle UX adjustments to specific pages is considered a refresh. </p> <p>However, if you want to make these changes to your website’s visual identity at the same time as major changes—like updating the site or a page’s infrastructure, code or overall functionality—this would be a good time to fully redesign your website. </p> <p>Remember, you’ll never really finish your website. You’ll always make minor updates and adjustments based on user experience and feedback, product changes or business growth. These small, continual changes make up your day-to-day website management. You should invest in good website management over redesigning or refreshing to ensure your brand's overall growth and success.</p> <h2>How often should you redesign your website?</h2> <p>Let the following factors help you gauge whether you should redesign your website:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Company updates, rebranding or new business goals.</strong> If your business or brand has recently gone through a rebranding process or updated major company goals like your brand purpose, mission or vision statement, this might be the right time to redesign a website. You want to ensure that your website accurately represents the company values and ideals. </li> <li><strong>Website performance.</strong> Does your website perform the way you anticipated? For example, does your site traffic convert users? How much time do users spend on specific pages? How do your new and returning users behave on your site? These questions can help you better understand your website performance. <strong>Tip:</strong> With <a href="https://www.wix.com/performance" target="_blank" >Wix website performance</a>, you can trust on reliable infrastructure and real-time monitoring to collect your site’s performance data. </li> <li><strong>Budget increase or decrease.</strong> Thriving businesses often have the budget to invest in a full-scale website redesign—but not so much for businesses with tight budgets. If small tweaks can help convert more users to boost sales, then consider a website refresh. </li> <li><strong>Industry changes</strong>. Imagine all your competitors suddenly integrate new technology into their websites. This may lead you to consider changing your own website, too. Also consider how the greater industry may impact your decision. For example, when Google first switched to mobile-first indexing, it pushed everyone in the industry to create and design mobile-friendly websites to maintain organic search traffic. </li> <li><strong>Time.</strong> Depending on the project’s scope, a website redesign may take longer than you anticipate. Sometimes uncovering certain issues can lead to other problems along the way. If you decide to pursue a website redesign, consider the time and effort needed to do it right. </li> </ul> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_dfcf03a8dd434502a86b1209407bb8b7~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_528,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="Wix Editor site themes used during website redesign"></figure><h2>How to redesign a website in 10 steps</h2> <p>Here, we’ve created a complete website redesign checklist to walk you through the steps. <strong>Tip:</strong> Don’t want to take on a redesign by yourself? <a href="https://www.wix.com/marketplace/hire/web-design" target="_blank" >Hire a professional website designer</a>.</p> <ol> <li>Determine if it's time to redesign your website </li> <li>Analyze and research your current website performance metrics (and competitors) </li> <li>Set your website redesign goals and create a plan </li> <li>Define your visual language, branding and messaging </li> <li>Create a sitemap </li> <li>Employ best design practices </li> <li>Update your site’s content </li> <li>Mind your SEO </li> <li>Optimize the mobile version </li> <li>Review and share your website redesign </li> </ol><h3>01. Determine if it's time to redesign your website</h3> <p>Knowing how to redesign a website requires time, planning and strategy. Before you begin, ask the following questions:</p><ul> <li>Is my site design outdated?</li> <li>Have I noticed a decrease in sales or conversions?</li> <li>Have users complained about the navigation or design?</li> <li>Did I recently rebrand my business?</li> </ul><p>If you answered ‘yes’ to any of these questions, a website redesign can benefit your business.</p> <h3>02. Analyze your current website performance metrics (and competitors)</h3> <p>Before changing your existing website, analyze its performance and that of the competition. </p> <p><strong>Analyze your current website:</strong> Review your existing site and go through its different pages. Evaluate what does and doesn’t work.</p> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> When you build your website with Wix, you can use <a href="https://www.wix.com/manage/analytics" target="_blank" >Wix Analytics</a> to track traffic, understand user behavior and analyze your revenue over time. With the help of tools, such as<a href="https://analytics.google.com/" target="_blank" > Google Analytics</a>, you can inspect your site’s data, too. </p> <p>Identify your most popular pages, an average user journey and your most successful call-to-action buttons (CTAs).</p> <p>Remain objective while analyzing your site’s pain points, as you’ll need to address them in the redesign. Take equal note of your current strengths, because you don’t have to completely transform everything on your site during the process. You probably don’t have to touch your best performing assets at all. In fact, they exemplify what works for your brand.</p> <p>You should analyze these metrics on a monthly basis:</p> <ul> <li>Traffic (number of visitors)</li> <li>Time on page</li> <li>Bounce rate</li> <li>Best performing keywords</li> <li>New leads</li> <li>Conversions</li> <li>Total pages indexed</li> <li>Sales generated</li> </ul> <p>This data not only indicates how your site performs, but they can also guide the website redesign process and serve as benchmarks to measure growth against. </p> <p><strong>Research the competition:</strong> Look closely at your top competitor’s websites. Pay attention to their design, website navigation, content and any marketing strategies that they employ. Keep an eye out for common industry practices, such as to<a href="https://www.wix.com/start/blog" target="_blank" > create a blog</a> or an <a href="https://www.wix.com/ecommerce/online-store" target="_blank" >online store</a>. These insights will help your website redesign meet (or even overtake) the competition.</p> <p><strong>Understand your market:</strong> To clearly define your target audience, conduct market research around your users and industry. Even if you’ve done this before, it’s worth looking into once more before redesigning your website, as your market and audience tends to change over time.</p> <p>By better understanding your customers, you’ll know certain traits such as what they like and dislike or their online browsing habits. This knowledge will help you tailor your website’s redesign to your users’ unique needs and preferences.</p> <p> </p><h3>03. Set your website redesign goals and create a plan</h3> <p>Write down what you’d like to achieve in your website redesign. Do you want to increase sales? Encourage newsletter subscriptions? Raise awareness of new products or deals? For each of your goals, specify which metrics you’ll use to track them. </p> <p>These clearly defined goals will help you devise a website redesign plan. After doing so, break down each of your desired website changes into concrete, actionable steps. For example, if you want to increase sales, you might incorporate a pop-up that offers a special discount. Then, decide on a viable timeframe for all your list items.</p> <p> If you work with a team, assign individual roles to keep everyone on track. By integrating your team into the website redesign process, your new design will benefit from their expertise and experience. You’ll also motivate your team and foster belonging and involvement.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p><h3>04. Define your visual language, branding and messaging</h3> <p>Deciding on your website’s look-and-feel is an important step before delving into the many required details. Make sure your visual language ties into your overall brand identity and matches your business’s tone, messaging and core values.</p> <p>To get your ideas flowing, look at web design inspiration and the latest<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2020/12/web-design-trends/" target="_blank" > web design trends</a>. Try to identify what best suits your brand and what could benefit your site’s functionality.</p> <p>At this stage, you should also gather all your needed website design assets. These include your<a href="https://www.wix.com/logo/maker" target="_blank" > logo</a>, brand colors and website color scheme. Ask yourself whether they still fit into your new style or need adjusting.</p> <p> </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_9a9469142c874b6784c344b72354d20a~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_528,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="Wix custom theme palette for sunglasses website and new summer collection"></figure><h3>05. Create a sitemap</h3> <p>A sitemap lists all your website pages as well as how they connect to each other. A clear and organized sitemap creates easy and intuitive website navigation, leading to a stellar user experience.</p> <p>On a piece of paper, map out a tree of your different website pages and how users can get to one from the other. Keep in mind important website navigation practices such as linking your logo to the homepage. Also consider that in as little as one or two clicks, site visitors should be able to get to any page on your site from their present location.</p> <p>As for the pages themselves, include the must-haves, such as a welcoming homepage, an About page and a contact section, as well as a services or products page. Also consider which other pages can add value to your site, such as an online store, a blog, or designated landing pages to encourage conversion.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_c3fe4a55237e47dbaaeb1d659deea6d7~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_528,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="Site map outlining shop section, about section and blog"></figure><p> </p> <h3>06. Employ best design practices</h3> <p>The design part of the website redesign happens now. Be sure to keep your brand identity in mind, as well as the main<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2018/07/7-principles-of-design-websites/" target="_blank" > principles of design</a>. The following tips will help steer you in the right direction:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Hierarchy: </strong>This leads site visitors to look at each site element in order of priority, starting with the most significant piece. This not only prevents clutter, but an unnecessary sense of urgency. Size and weight (like a larger and bolder letter size for titles) and element placement (like placing an important CTA button at the very center of the screen) can help you to achieve this. </li> <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> This highlights the differences between parts of the design. While elements that look alike tend to blend together, contrasting elements stand out more. You can achieve contrast through texture (such as plain versus patterned), brightness (light versus dark) and, the most common one, color. Checking your website’s color contrast is an important website accessibility practice, as you’ll need to ensure that your site is clearly legible. </li> <li><strong>Balance:</strong> Each of your pages should be well-balanced and harmonious. A good way to understand balance is to think of your webpage as a scale, with its elements distributed equally on both sides. There are many ways to go about such even distribution, as balance can be symmetrical, asymmetrical or radial. Whichever you choose, the resulting look should always feel cohesive, leaving nothing out of place. </li> <li><strong>Use of imagery:</strong> Incorporate high-quality media features to support your message, such as photographs, icons or vector art. Your imagery could showcase your product or simply set the right mood. For example, a nutrition and wellness website may use a photo of plants to create a soothing vibe. </li> <li><strong>Typography:</strong> This is the practice of arranging text. It relates to everything from the choice of font to the letter size and weight. While typography is an artform in itself, a few simple rules can guide you through using type on your website: Pick one to three fonts (but no more) and use them consistently throughout the site. The paragraph text should be the most easily legible, while the title font can be more decorative, with unique touches like cursive or old-style serifs.</li> </ul> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_2662dfdf54344a9ead38bc42d106b676~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_528,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="Principles of design including: balance, contrast, emphasis, movement, hierarchy and white space"></figure><p> </p><h3>07. Update your site’s content</h3> <p>A big part of<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2019/08/how-to-update-a-website" target="_blank" > updating your website</a> is freshening up the content. However, you don’t need to update all your content. Take note of your high-performing content and understand why it does well. This can help guide your updating process for underperforming content.</p> <p>In addition, if you map out your highest performing content, you will know how to maximize it in your website redesign. Things to look out for include:</p> <ul> <li>Most viewed content</li> <li>Most shared content</li> <li>Pages with the highest traffic volume</li> <li>Content that ranks for intended keywords </li> <li>Inbound links to specific pages</li> </ul> <p>When writing your website’s content, keep your target audience in mind. This will help you craft text that is less about you and your product (which can come off as salesy), and more about your users and their needs. Use written copy to provide an answer to their questions and guide them through the site.</p> <p>Additionally, keep your text short and sweet. Since many readers skim, concise sentences are especially effective. Other things to keep in mind when updating content during your website redesign include:</p> <p><strong>Tone of voice:</strong> Your tone of voice should be in line with your brand identity. Write the way you’d want your brand to sound had it been a person. Is it personal and friendly or professional and authoritative?</p> <p><strong>Microcopy:</strong> Microcopy plays an important part in your site’s text. This term refers to the short bits of text on anything from your call-to-action buttons (CTAs) to your online forms. Try to make your microcopy conversational, so that it sounds more like humans wrote it and less like cold lines of code. For example, a sign up button can go beyond a simple “OK,” and say anything from “Sign Me Up!” to “Let’s Go.”</p> <p><strong>Intent:</strong> Whether a blog article, a product description or an email newsletter, always think of what your user intends to do when writing text. What motivates them? What will satisfy their needs? Writing with this in mind will help you reach your audience in a more authentic and meaningful way.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p><h3>08. Mind your SEO</h3> <p>Search engine optimization, or SEO, is the practice of improving your website’s visibility and ranking on Google search results to boost your organic traffic. Optimizing your website for SEO is an important part of your website redesign, as it can enhance its discoverability.</p><p>To help people find your business on Google, we recommend checking out the<a href="https://www.wix.com/seo" target="_blank" > Wix SEO Hub</a> for in-depth guidance, as well as the following methods:</p> <p><strong>Use of keywords:</strong> Conduct keyword research and choose two to three keywords to describe your business (short phrases or terms that people would type into search engines when looking for a business similar to yours). Use these keywords strategically around your website, including your SEO titles and descriptions. Make sure that the keywords fit seamlessly into your content, as recent Google algorithm updates pay special attention to context.</p> <p><strong>Alt-text:</strong> Writing alt-text for images on your website strengthens both its SEO and<a href="https://www.wix.com/accessibility" target="_blank" > web accessibility</a>. You can do this by adding a few words that describe your image's content. Your alt-text won’t be immediately visible to your users, but is nonetheless highly beneficial for Google bots and assistive technologies.</p> <p><strong>Page meta tags:</strong> Writing your page’s meta tags—including its title tags and descriptions, helps search engine bots better understand your page’s content and correctly display it in search results. Whenever possible, include keywords in your meta tags.</p> <p><strong>Domain name:</strong> Keeping your domain name consistent over time can help your brand’s recognizability. However, if you’ve changed your<a href="https://www.wix.com/tools/business-name-generator" target="_blank" > business name</a> or expanded the scope of your brand, you might want to <a href="https://www.wix.com/domain/domain-name-search" target="_blank" >change your domain name</a> to reflect that.</p> <p> </p> <h3>09. Optimize the mobile version</h3> <p>Ensure that visitors experience your site as smoothly on-the-go with an equally intuitive mobile website. Declutter the screen and remove unnecessary elements so that only the most essential content stands out on the smaller screen. You can also take advantage of mobile website design features such as a branded welcome screen or animations.</p> <p>On top of improving your user experience, a mobile-friendly website also benefits SEO. In fact, Google uses mobile-first indexing.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_c82b16f6c0be48c9b0fd540cbacdb7c4~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_588,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="T-Shop t-shirt website on desktop and mobile versions"></figure><p> </p><h3>10. Review and share your website redesign</h3> <p>Give your new design a thorough review, proofreading its written content, checking the navigation flow and ensuring that all links work properly. Double check even the smallest of details. Ask a few trusted friends or team members to inspect the site as well.</p> <p>Once your website redesign is ready, give it a marketing boost to support the launch. Sharing your fresh new design on social media and in a newsletter announcement can drive traffic to your website.</p> <p> </p> <h2>How long does a website redesign take?</h2> <p>There is no fixed set amount of time it takes to redesign a website, since every website varies in size and purpose. For example, a large corporate website redesign may take much more time than a personal portfolio website. Yet, having said that, both website redesigns require the same attention to detail and process.</p> <p>In general, prepare for one to three months for a basic website redesign, but depending on the size of the website it may take up to 6+ months. </p> <p>Once you’ve mapped out the goals and the project scope, try to stick to the timeline as best as possible. Remember, don’t rush the process—you’re undergoing a redesign to improve the site experience for both your business and for the users. </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_67d80527694c497593b8b63f36f0b5d1~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_60,h_60,al_c,q_80/file.png" ></figure><p><strong>By Kylie Goldstein</strong></p> <p>Content Marketer and Branding Expert</p> ]]>

Branding is mnemonic, meaning that it enforces a consumer’s association with your company to solidify it in their memory. How can you harness this power and build a brand that leaves a lasting impression on your audience? In this guide, we will define branding, discuss its importance and offer tips for how to build a brand.</p> <h2>What is branding?</h2> <p>In a nutshell, branding refers to the deliberate actions you take to influence people’s perception of your product or service. To quote author and entrepreneur <a href="https://seths.blog/2009/12/define-brand/" target="_blank" >Seth Godin</a>, “A brand is the set of expectations, memories, stories and relationships that, taken together, account for a consumer’s decision to choose one product or service over another.” In other words, branding consists of every opportunity you have to influence those decisions—from the way you <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/01/how-to-come-up-with-a-brand-name/" target="_blank" >come up with a brand name</a>, design your logo and advertisements to the way you build your website and layout your store.</p> <p>Because every type of business involves different interactions with customers, they each involve different branding opportunities and challenges. Let’s define the different <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/06/types-of-branding/" target="_blank" >types of branding</a> and discuss their particular nuances:</p> <h3>Product branding</h3> <p><a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2018/09/product-branding-guide/" target="_blank" >Product branding</a> refers to the design, quality, functionality, packaging and pricing that form a product’s identity. Product branding aims to make an item stand out in the marketplace, so consumers can easily identify and choose it among others.</p> <h3>Service branding</h3> <p><a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/06/professional-services-branding/" target="_blank" >Service branding</a> is less tangible than product branding and involves many more variables, making it a much more difficult endeavor. A service business has to ensure that its operating environment, the employees and company policies create a unified identity. </p> <p> </p> <h3>Online branding </h3> <p>Online branding focuses on the way a company represents itself online. Social media marketing, email marketing, blogging and website design offer opportunities to strengthen your brand. </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_b3671a7e61684f248854f9821f3974d2~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_562,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="The online branding for a fitness company's website and social media."></figure> <h3>Offline branding</h3><p> </p> <p>Offline branding is the way a consumer interacts with a brand in the physical world. It’s your brick-and-mortar signage, interior decor and scent. It’s the lighting, the playlist and the affect of your employees. It’s the events you host and the outdoor advertisements you utilize. Basically, it’s the vibes your customer gets from an in-person experience with your business.</p> <p> </p> <p>Offline branding is not as easily tested or monitored. You have to pay attention to your customers and their mood while in your store. Furthermore, you should ask for feedback whenever possible.</p> <p>Although the branding strategies differ from those used online, your offline branding should complement your online branding rather than exist as something distinct.</p> <h3>Co-branding</h3> <p>Think of Martha Stewart and Snoop Dog: their personal brands are strong on their own, but together they've created an unstoppable joint brand. This clever marketing strategy is called <a href="https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/co-branding" target="_blank" >co-branding</a>, or a collaboration between distinct businesses. The strategy enables the involved businesses to share their target audience and broaden their reach. </p> <h3>Corporate branding</h3> <p><a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/04/corporate-branding/" target="_blank" >Corporate branding</a> emanates through everything the organization sells and how it operates. By providing an umbrella identity, the corporation links all the brands that live underneath it. </p> <p>Some corporations, such as Unilever—which owns hundreds of brands, from Dove to Hellman’s—enable the brands that live underneath it to develop unique identities. On the other hand, corporations like Alphabet—which owns Google, Android, Nest and others—prioritize continuity over distinction. </p> <p>The latter type of corporate branding follows the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317215835_Corporate_brand_idenity_and_image_to_align_or_separate_-_this_is_the_question" target="_blank" >Vision-Culture-Image model</a>, which calls for all brands to align across these three components. Whether a corporation’s distinct brands maintain a tangible through-line matters less than whether they all stay within the organizational ethos. </p> <h3>Personal branding</h3> <p><a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2019/06/personal-branding-the-ultimate-guide/" target="_blank" >Personal branding</a> encompasses your reputation and your personal and professional image. You emphasize your personal brand via tools like your CV, social media posts, website design and business cards. For inspiration, check out these <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/05/business-card-ideas/" target="_blank" >business card ideas</a>, or <a href="https://www.wix.com/business-card/maker" target="_blank" >create a business card</a> of your own. </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_93ee240ed15849649124fdee9c7ab519~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_517,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="A business card that uses the brand's colors and logo."></figure> <h2>Why is branding important?</h2> <p>People form their first impressions of someone before they even realize it—researchers at Princeton found that <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01750.x" target="_blank" >people can get a read on someone in fewer than 100 milliseconds</a>. Thoughtful brand strategy makes the most of those milliseconds and influences the impressions a consumer forms of your business. </p> <p>Let’s dig into the ways branding affects your business:</p> <h3>It introduces your business</h3> <p><a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/01/brand-awareness/" target="_blank" >Brand awareness</a> refers to the ways in which both the market and consumers perceive your business. Ideally, you want customers to have a positive impression of your brand and your offered service or products. Strong brand awareness encourages your target audience to select your brand explicitly, even over cheaper or alternative options.</p> <h3>It set you apart from the competition</h3> <p>Regardless of your industry, competition is always fierce. Whether you’re opening a bike repair shop, selling CBD-infused products or becoming a social media consultant—branding allows you to differentiate yourself from your competitors. By highlighting what you offer, you can distinguish why your brand is the better choice.</p> <h3>It creates a sense of familiarity</h3> <p>A key component of brand awareness, <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/04/brand-recognition/" target="_blank" >brand recognition</a> applies more pointedly to the ways in which consumers remember your product or service, also known as brand recall. Visual branding assets, like brand colors, a logo or a <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2018/11/catchy-slogan-examples/" target="_blank" >catchy slogan</a>, can prompt this brand recall. For example, imagine you’re on a road trip, and on the highway in the distance, you see golden arches—without even thinking about it, you already identified McDonald's.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_07845dc96e2e4f2a9125c1f25bededaa~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_978,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="Options for branding merchandise"></figure> <h3>It builds trust</h3> <p><a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/ecommerce/2020/05/what-is-brand-trust" target="_blank" >Brand trust</a> is important both for impressing potential customers and your industry at large. According to<a href="https://www.intelligencenode.com/blog/50-statistics-to-understand-the-online-consumer-in-2020-and-beyond/" target="_blank" > Intelligence Node</a>, “over 60% of online adults in Canada, the US, and Europe want the companies they buy from to be transparent about their business practices.”</p> <p>A company with a strong brand not only presents itself as more professional and polished, but also evokes trust through transparency and authenticity. Beyond this, outlining your brand values and keeping your brand promises can encourage prospective and current customers to believe and support your brand.</p> <h3>It gives your business an identity </h3> <p>Just as each person has their own unique identity, so does your brand. Imagine you’re setting up two friends on a blind date, and you need to describe each person to the other. How might you identify or characterize them? Try to think of your brand as a person rather than a commodity or an object. Known formally as “brand anthropomorphism,” this idea challenges you to visualize your brand like a human to better define how the brand acts, speaks, dresses, communicates or impacts the world.</p> <h3>It establishes employee pride</h3> <p>Employees who stand behind their brand and take pride in their work are not only good for business, but they also shape your brand’s public perception. This can influence the ways customers identify your brand, but it can also encourage prospective employees to seek out your company. A well-branded company should make workers feel a sense of belonging, overall satisfaction and pride. This will encourage them to authentically promote the brand across all types of channels and platforms.</p> <h3>It enhance your business value</h3> <p>Whether you’re a small business owner or an established corporation, branding plays an important role in validating your financial value and building your<a href="https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/brand-equity" target="_blank" > brand equity</a>. Your company’s growth can depend on successful branding when attracting new customers, generating business or breaking into new markets. Even more, in regard to expanding your venture, an expertly-branded business can attract potential investors.</p> <h2>How to build a brand</h2> <p>You can read our full guide on <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2020/04/how-to-build-a-brand/" target="_blank" >how to build a brand</a> for more in-depth steps, but let’s get started with a brief overview:</p> <ol> <li>Build a strong brand strategy </li> <li>Figure out your ‘why’ </li> <li>Sculpt your brand identity </li> <li>Write your brand story </li> <li>Design your visual branding </li> <li>Build a branded website </li> <li>Develop a style guide </li> <li>Manage your brand </li> <li>Expand your brand </li> </ol> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_77b057782f15421e8fd14bb3bde0596d~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_925,h_824,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="Brand identity, brand awareness, brand logo, brand strategy, brand trust, brand loyalty, brand voice, and brand perception."></figure> <h3>01. Build a strong brand strategy</h3> <p>To develop a strong brand, you need to strategize each step along the way. Your <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/01/brand-strategy/" target="_blank" >brand strategy</a> serves as a roadmap to guide each aspect of your branding efforts, from your design to your customer service. Through research, analysis, planning and preparation, you can outline long-term goals and achieve great branding results.</p> <h3>02. Figure out your ‘why’</h3> <p>Before you can dive into color palettes and logo design, you must first identify your core purpose. Your <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/01/brand-manifesto/" target="_blank" >brand manifesto</a>—or the statement that represents the motivation behind your brand—should thread your brand together. It’s your brand’s raison d’etre. Make sure to include these elements in your brand manifesto: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Mission statement</strong>: A mission statement is a vital part of your branding efforts, expressing your brand purpose and brand values. In no more than a few sentences, this branding element should let anyone who encounters your brand (from your customers to your investors and competitors) clearly understand what you’re all about. Think of your brand mission statement as a ‘why’ explanation that guides not only what your business offers but the purpose behind it. </li> </ul><ul> <li><strong>Vision statement</strong>: Like your mission statement, your vision statement clearly and concisely articulates your strategic business goals. It serves as a roadmap to guide your company’s initial stages and your brand’s future. Your brand vision can evolve over time and grow with your business, but should always remain consistent with your core brand values.</li> </ul><ul> <li><strong>Brand values</strong>: Consumers crave transparency and authenticity and want to connect with brands that uphold similar values. Your brand values are the foundation of your business and trickle into each aspect of your branding. Imagine these values as a compass directing and supporting your brand purpose and story as well as your decisions and actions. When it comes to defining your brand values, think of how you want your business to influence and impact the bigger picture.</li> </ul> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_885c0c8d568e4dd79c2f98442e871b0d~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_562,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="The mission statement of a skincare company, &quot;We always put sustainability at the core of everything we do.&quot; The web design complements the brand voice."></figure> <h3>03. Sculpt your brand identity</h3> <p>Once you’ve defined your business’s intrinsic value, you can start crafting its identity. A <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2018/10/what-is-brand-identity-how-to-create-your-own/" target="_blank" >brand identity</a> is its personality. It’s the full picture that your <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/04/brand-messaging/" target="_blank" >brand messaging</a>—or the visual and non-visual ways your company communicates—represents. Not sure what personality fits your brand? Check out these <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/02/brand-identity-examples/" target="_blank" >brand identity examples</a> for inspiration. Also keep in mind how your brand identity differs from brand image—or the ways other people view your brand. </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_e4e8cada310049b2a290b52ef5ad8902~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_925,h_880,al_c,q_80/file.png" ></figure><h3>04. Write your brand story</h3> <p>Stories captivate, engage, intrigue and connect. Your<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/02/brand-story/" target="_blank" > brand story</a> should set the tone for all content and branding assets, from your social media posts to your marketing campaigns—even when deciding <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2019/11/how-to-design-a-business-card/" target="_blank" >how to design a business card</a>. This means staying consistent and authentic. For example, a brand story can introduce company founders and the origin of the business, or highlight a tale of passion and purpose behind why a brand exists. Whatever the approach, your brand story offers an opportunity to create connections and highlight the qualities of your brand with your audience.</p> <h3>05. Design your visual branding</h3> <p>Because people tend to judge a book by its cover, your <a href="https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/visual-language" target="_blank" >visual language</a> is your best weapon in building <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/04/brand-recognition/" target="_blank" >brand recognition</a>. The most important visual branding aspects include your:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Logo</strong>: When it comes time to figure out how to design a logo for your brand, keep in mind that this branding element carries significant importance. And with power, comes great responsibility. This small symbol is a visual representation of your company. Your logo can evoke emotion, persuade or inspire your customers just from a single glance. Take the time to craft an authentic design that represents your brand identity.</li> </ul><ul> <li><strong>Brand colors</strong>: When it comes to <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2020/01/brand-colors/" target="_blank" >brand colors</a>, there is more than meets the eye. While it is often subliminal, color conveys messages, triggers emotions and ultimately affects your brand perception in the minds (and eyes) of consumers. Consider how color psychology can influence your consumers’ buying decisions. For example, red is an attention-grabbing hue associated with passion, energy, excitement and danger, while blue is a much calmer color, linked to trust, peace and stability. </li> </ul><ul> <li><strong>Typography</strong>: Typography refers to the letter forms including their design and layout that are used in various branding features. Similar to your brand colors, the typography you choose shapes your brand and helps get your message across. In general, when it comes to typography, branding experts recommend you stick to three or fewer font styles. Whether you use it in your logo design, website content or product packaging, keep everything aligned and cohesive to develop brand consistency. For a branding typography example, check out<a href="https://www.wix.com/typeface/madefor" target="_blank" > Madefor</a>, the custom digital-first typeface by Wix.</li> </ul> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_105579b674c84e2393e646210a2a2f07~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_517,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="An example of a set of brand colors"></figure> <h3>06. Build a branded website</h3> <p>A professional website is an essential branding asset and a critical part of your digital marketing strategy. The type of website you create will depend on your industry, but nonetheless it will attract new visitors, generate leads, promote and sell products, educate and inform customers and most of all—communicate.</p> <p>When you<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/02/how-to-make-a-website/" target="_blank" > build a Wix website</a>, you can customize it to suit your business needs with a range of<a href="https://www.wix.com/website/templates" target="_blank" > free templates</a> and advanced<a href="https://www.wix.com/tools" target="_blank" > free tools</a>. Make sure your customers instantly know what your brand is all about and what it offers. From your homepage to your blog posts to your<a href="https://www.wix.com/ascend/email-marketing" target="_blank" > email marketing campaigns</a>, your website should showcase your brand in the best possible light.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_7f27461200974eab9588d01c7f667bf1~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_562,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="A startup consulting business website that states its vision statement: &quot;Our vision is to build a bright future for the young generation.&quot;"></figure> <h3>07. Develop a style guide</h3> <p>Branding is a strategic and critical process that requires creativity. Since you’ll consider many branding elements, it is wise to create a strong and cohesive <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2020/07/brand-style-guide/" target="_blank" >brand style guide</a> to catalog both visual and non-visual elements. If you're looking for a little inspiration, you can explore these<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/10/style-guide-examples/" target="_blank" > style guide examples</a> to help you get started.</p> <h3>08. Manage your brand</h3> <p>Branding is an ongoing process that requires thought, awareness and conscientious<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/07/brand-management/" target="_blank" > brand management</a>. Even the most successful brands are always evolving to grow authentically. When it comes to successfully managing your brand, keep in mind the following:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Consistency is key</strong>: In the pursuit of recognition, trust and brand loyalty, consistency is a vital aspect of branding. Customers will return time and again to the dependable companies that maintain a unified and consistent brand across all their platforms.</li> </ul><ul> <li><strong>Reputation is everything</strong>: We all know a person or a place that has a bad reputation, and we avoid it at all costs. We even avoid things based on what others say, without even experiencing it firsthand. Sometimes companies can go through a<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/08/rebranding/" target="_blank" > rebranding</a> process to overcome potential challenges, but it’s better to strive for a positive<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/03/brand-reputation/" target="_blank" > brand reputation</a> right from the start.</li> </ul><ul> <li><strong>Stick to your promises</strong>: Keeping your word and delivering on your promises is an essential aspect of brand management. This includes the brand promise you make to your customers, employees and stakeholders, as well as the actions you take to uphold it.</li> </ul><ul> <li><strong>Keep the conversation going</strong>: It’s important to develop and open a continuous dialogue between your brand and your consumers, both on and offline. However, you must take it one step further to not only engage with your audience but also ask questions, actively listen to criticism and implement changes based on the genuine and credible feedback. </li> </ul><ul> <li><strong>Build meaningful relationships</strong>: The best customers are loyal—the ones who not only love your brand but keep coming back. Whether they are your brand ambassadors or life-long customers, it all boils down to differentiation, engagement and loyalty. Make sure you take good care of these vital relationships—that’s what it’s really about, isn’t it?</li> </ul> <h3>09. Expand your brand</h3> <p>As your brand grows and expands, you will find new ways to stretch your offerings through <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/10/brand-extension/" target="_blank" >brand extension</a>. You know how Dyson now makes hair dryers or Hyundai Motors makes electronics? This is a perfect example of how businesses with established brands can extend their offering into new markets. When done right, it can be an excellent strategy for increasing brand awareness and revenue. But beware: When done wrong, it can lead to <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/10/brand-dilution/" target="_blank" >brand dilution</a> and confuse loyal customers. </p> <h2>4 branding examples</h2> <p>Need some inspiration? Let’s look at four examples of effective branding:</p> <h3>Oatly</h3> <p>If we had to choose one business that gets<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/09/gen-z-branding/" target="_blank" > Gen Z branding</a> right, it would have to be Oatly. The company—which makes milk, ice cream and yogurt out of oats—stands out in the crowded dairy-alternatives market with lighthearted copy and a visual language to match. To really hit the Gen Z sweet spot, they are as serious about their commitment to sustainability as they are playful.</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_0ba3886a03f44a468c39f0e6bb1bbfbf~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_562,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="The online shopping page of Oatly's well-branded website."></figure> <h3>Kylie Jenner</h3> <p>Take a look at Kylie Jenner. Known as the one of the youngest billionaires in the world, Jenner is a prime example of personal branding done right. Having started her career on Keeping up with the Kardashians, Jenner has leveraged herself on social media and with her lucrative makeup business,<a href="https://www.kyliecosmetics.com/" target="_blank" > Kylie Cosmetics</a>.</p> <p>Beyond her companies, Jenner has used her personal life to iconically brand herself and promote her products. For example, when she first launched her famous lip kits, she shared videos of herself using them on social media and as a result they sold out within hours. She also models all her own products on her website and in her ad campaigns.</p> <p>Furthermore, Jenner’s personal branding approach is strategic, and constantly evolving by paying attention to (and setting) trends targeting her loyal followers. Jenner lives and breathes her products with authenticity, focus and shares her real experiences (even when they fail).</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_1bc5f563742145488b76b0eb51f80216~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_924,h_562,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="The website of Kylie Jenner's cosmetics company, which capitalizes on her strategic personal branding."></figure> <h3>Southwest</h3> <p>From the goofy flight attendants to the egalitarian open seating policy, Southwest distinguishes itself as a friendly, down-to-earth airline that is honest and reliable. It uses a heart logo and a quirky, pun-forward <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/02/brand-voice/" target="_blank" >brand voice</a> (the “Transfarency” ad campaign has been running for the past seven years) to emphasize its identity. Whereas most low-cost carriers are seen as the last-ditch option, Southwest has successfully used “The Everyman” <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/11/brand-archetypes/" target="_blank" >brand archetype</a> to build a <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/03/brand-image/" target="_blank" >brand image</a> (or reputation) as “the good guys” in the eyes of their fiercely loyal customers.</p> <h3>Macbook</h3> <p>A MacBook is the pièce de résistance of product branding. The unboxing experience is supreme: You open the smooth, modular packaging to reveal a gleaming device remiss of sharp corners. When opening the computer for the first time, the screen automatically boots up with a gentle gong sound—<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/05/sonic-branding/" target="_blank" >sonic branding</a> at its finest. All of it adds up to a humanistic and forward-thinking brand personality. </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/84b06e_67d80527694c497593b8b63f36f0b5d1~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_60,h_60,al_c,q_80/file.png" ></figure><p><strong>By Kylie Goldstein</strong></p> <p>Content Marketer and Branding Expert</p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_2a0d09728dba463da9d4f62042fa084a~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_60,h_60,al_c,q_80/file.png" ></figure><p><strong>By Emily Shwake</strong></p> <p>Wix Blog Writer</p> ]]>

Informative, engaging content can reach new customers and maintain current ones. Even <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010126005200/http:/www.microsoft.com/billgates/columns/1996essay/essay960103.asp" target="_blank" >Bill Gates</a> knew back in 1996 that “Content is king.”</p> <p>From <a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank" >creating a website</a> to strategizing your <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/09/social-media-content/" target="_blank" >social media content</a>, you’ll often share links to videos, articles and social media posts. A link shortening tool can be a handy way to optimize these links for your content marketing strategy. </p> <p>In this article, we’ll discuss why compressed URLs can help your marketing. Plus, we’ll go over some of the best link shorteners on the market. </p> <h2>What is a link shortener?</h2> <p>A link shortener—also known as a URL shortener, link compressor, or URL condenser—is a digital tool that takes a long URL and makes it shorter. This URL tool serves self-creators or small businesses in many ways. In fact, the US government found this tool important enough to provide two types of <a href="https://digital.gov/2013/12/20/gov-url-shorteners-and-how-to-use-them/" target="_blank" >government-funded link shortenings</a>, although they decommissioned the project in 2019.</p> <p>If you want to share a link for any<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/06/types-of-marketing/" target="_blank" > type of marketing</a>, whether <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2018/11/social-media-marketing/" target="_blank" >social media marketing</a> or your weekly newsletter, most people don’t find website links littered with excess numbers and letters attractive. A lengthy URL can even deter people from clicking. Link shorteners condense the long URLs in your <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/12/marketing-strategies/" target="_blank" >marketing strategy </a>so people will be more inclined to click on them, in turn increasing click-through rates.</p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu2SBiuD17A&t=1s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu2SBiuD17A&t=1s</a><h2>4 reasons to use a link shortener</h2><h3>01. Elevates your brand image</h3> <p>Excess characters in URLs can look suspicious and unappealing. Use a link shortener to keep your marketing assets clean and concise, which reflects positively on your brand image.</p> <h3>02. Easier to share</h3> <p>If your users find a link easier to copy and paste, especially from a mobile device, they’ll be more likely to share your links.</p> <h3>03. Cleaner appearance</h3> <p>People have an easier time reading and comprehending shorter text, making them more likely to click on shorter URLs.</p> <h3>04. Provides tracking capabilities</h3> <p>To sustainably grow your brand, you must track your marketing efforts and key performance indicators (KPIs). Most link shorteners come with analytics tools and other advanced features. </p> <h2>10 of the best link shorteners</h2><h3>01. Hopp.co</h3> <p><a href="https://hopp.co/?utm_source=wixblog&#38;utm_campaign=best_url_shorteners" target="_blank" >Hopp.co</a> is the ideal free URL shortener for online content creators who want to increase their revenue and customer base.

Hopp.co’s ability to add a “pre-roll” customized promotional page is what makes this link shortener a real winner. Creators can send users to an interstitial page before their final destination where they can add a CTA or link that promotes a service, video, event, social account, blog post or product; collects subscribers or contact information; and even promotes a membership. They also offer call-to-action landing pages and a “speed-dial” feature, which allows users to enter a code and access a link—a handy feature for those looking for a link sharing workaround for Instagram posts.</p> <h3>02. Sniply</h3> <p><a href="https://sniply.io/" target="_blank" >Sniply</a> allows users to compress long links and overlay them with custom call-to-actions (CTAs) to create visually appealing mini banners. </p> <h3>03. ClickMeter </h3> <p><a href="https://clickmeter.com/" target="_blank" >ClickMeter</a>’s URL shortening tool offers marketers a dashboard to analyze data from large, global audiences, plus optimize and compare links in one place. The tool targets visitors where they will have the best conversion rates, monitors fraud and broken links, tracks clicks and conversions, and more. </p> <h3>04. Cuttly</h3> <p><a href="https://cutt.ly/" target="_blank" >Cuttly</a>’s platform can manage and track analytics from users' branded URLs.

Users with a premium plan can customize their shortened URLs with their own domain names. Bitly comes with an analytics dashboard to help users comprehend which campaigns and content their audiences prefer. </p> <h3>06. TinyURL</h3> <p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/app" target="_blank" >TinyURL</a>’s basic link shortening tool does not require users to create an account, but it also doesn’t offer advanced analytics. Paid users get basic tracking tools such as click rates, URL editing and timestamps.</p> <h3>07.

But taking the time to consider your options, build a plan and talk to experts can set you up for success in the long run. We asked Holly Wade, executive director of the National Federation of Independent Businesses Research Center, how to raise money for business and decide which common business funding sources fit your needs.</p> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Before you start raising capital for your business, create a <a href="https://www.wix.com/business/website" target="_blank" >business website</a>. It’ll function as a virtual business card you can share with potential lenders and investors. </p> <h2>How to raise money for business</h2> <p>Whether you want startup financing or capital to grow your business, these tips will help you make your case to lenders and investors.</p> <ol> <li>Create a strong business plan </li> <li>Apply to SBA-guaranteed lenders </li> <li>Beef up your resume </li> <li>Carefully consider your financing options </li> <li>Watch out for predatory lenders </li> </ol> <h3>01. Create a strong business plan</h3> <p>A strong <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2019/11/business-plan-template-step-by-step-guide/" target="_blank" >business plan</a> should be the first step in raising capital for your business. If it can’t stand up to some poking and prodding, most lenders and investors won’t hesitate to say no. You need to show them (and yourself): </p> <ul> <li>You know how much money you need</li> <li>You have a strategy to efficiently use that money</li> <li>You have an estimate on how long it will take to see a return on the investment</li> </ul> <p>Wade says you can use a strong business plan not only to sell people on your idea but also to facilitate a conversation about your business with a financial expert. “Talk to a small business loan officer at a local bank about your business plan and what might be available to you and in what time frame,” says Wade. “I think having that conversation is really important to build that relationship.” Those talks help show the loan officer you’ll run your business methodically and that they can trust you with the bank’s money. </p> <h3>02. Apply to SBA-guaranteed lenders</h3> <p>Wade recommends looking for banks participating in the Small Business Association (SBA) loan program. They’ll offer loans to small businesses more willingly. “They can offer these loans with the assurance that the SBA will guarantee the loan if the small business owner defaults,” she explains. </p> <p>In addition to being more accessible, <a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans" target="_blank" >SBA-backed lenders offer benefits</a> like lower down-payments, flexible overhead requirements and unsecured loans. In some cases, the lenders also offer counseling and won’t require collateral. Although the <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/small-business/small-business-loan-rates-fees" target="_blank" >interest rate</a> for SBA loans (9.25–11.75%) is higher than that of a traditional bank loan (3.19-6.78%), it’s still competitive. </p> <h3>03. Beef up your resume</h3> <p>Banks reject <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_kb3Z-XvsQ&#38;list=PLrwM1ZVcvDhYQCoQuv2w1Idq0YALJJSbk&#38;index=13" target="_blank" >business loan applications</a> when they think the applicant doesn’t have the understanding, experience or commitment to run your business effectively in the long-term. Working at a similar business for a year can introduce you to the industry and show your loan officer you know what it takes to start your own. If you’ve worked in the industry outside of a managerial role, consider taking a business class or two to learn the basics. </p> <h3>04. Carefully consider your financing options</h3> <p>Don’t just take the money offered to you. Think carefully about the risks and benefits of each business financing option. If asking someone to invest, think about whether you want to tether your business to the investor in the long-term. Ask them about the role they expect to play and what they want from the partnership.</p> <h3>05. Watch out for predatory lenders</h3> <p>A good lender or investor will likely consider your pitch or application thoughtfully. If the person is pushy, you can assume they don’t have your best interest at heart and may even try to pressure you into a bad loan. “It’s always good to take a breath, step back, think it through and see if there’s any more information before going forward,” says Wade. “If you’re just not quite sure about it, talk about it with a small business loan officer, a <a href="https://www.score.org/" target="_blank" >SCORE business mentor</a> or other small business owners.”</p> <p>Watch out for these <a href="https://www.sba.gov/about-sba/oversight-advocacy/office-inspector-general/protect-yourself-scams-fraud" target="_blank" >predatory lender</a> red flags:</p> <ul> <li>The contract doesn’t list the annual percentage rate (APR) or the full payment schedule</li> <li>The APR is higher than <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/loans/personal-loans/what-is-predatory-lending" target="_blank" >36%</a></li> <li>The deal seems too good to be true</li> <li>The fees exceed 3% of the loan value</li> <li>The lender asks for an up-front payment</li> </ul> <h2>4 small business funding sources</h2> <p>Most small businesses rely on four traditional <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/07/business-funding/" target="_blank" >small business funding</a> sources. Here, we’ll discuss the pros and cons of each to help build your business financing plan:</p> <h3>01. Personal assets</h3> <p>In most cases, people use personal assets for <a href="https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/15122206/FinanceFAQ-Final-Feb2022.pdf" target="_blank" >business financing</a>. According to the United States Census Bureau, 74.7% of small businesses contribute their own savings to their <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2018/econ/abs/2018-abs-characteristics-of-businesses.html" target="_blank" >startup capital</a>. Additionally, 10% use personal credit cards, 6.3% use home equity and 10% use other personal assets.</p> <p>Wade explains that ease, security and availability make people rely on personal assets for business financing. “It’s generally very hard for a business to access financing through a bank unless they’ve been profitable for a few years,” says Wade. “Also, most startup businesses don’t want to start off in debt.” </p> <p>If you do need to raise more money than you have in the bank, investing your own money shows investors you’re committed to and confident in your business. </p> <h3>02. Friends and family</h3> <p>It can be a safe bet to source your business financing from people who know you and believe in your mission. Unlike investors and banks, your friends and family will less likely charge you high interest rates (if they charge you any at all). Additionally, it won’t ruin your credit if it takes you longer than expected to turn a profit.</p> <p>Keep in mind, though, your friends and family may want more transparent information about your business’s health than a bank would since they’ve assumed a high risk. Additionally, you risk damaging your relationships if you can’t pay them back in the agreed-upon time frame.</p> <p>To prevent any unpleasant scenarios, complete your due diligence. Make sure you have the full picture of your existing finances and a return-on-investment projection that shows you can pay off the loan. Work out a loan agreement that clearly sets the expectations and repayment timeline.</p> <h3>03. Loans</h3> <p>Even with investors and crowdfunding, <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/11/how-to-get-a-business-loan/" target="_blank" >business loans</a> still remain a core option for raising money for business. After personal savings, Bank loans were the <a href="https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/15122206/FinanceFAQ-Final-Feb2022.pdf" target="_blank" >second-most-common business financing option</a>. Still, the process is difficult. “Banks are not in the business of lending money to startup businesses because of the risk involved,” says Wade. “And most startup businesses don’t want to start off in debt.”</p> <p>Because of the mutual hesitancy, only <a href="https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/15122206/FinanceFAQ-Final-Feb2022.pdf" target="_blank" >19% of small businesses use bank loans</a> for business financing. That said, a loan may be a viable option if you and your loved ones don’t have the capital you need to start a business.</p> <h3>04. Credit cards</h3> <p>Credit cards aren’t as popular as bank loans for startup financing because of the high interest rates and short pay periods. Businesses do find them useful for subsidizing cash flow. If you can’t keep up with bills and don’t have access to emergency funds, a credit card can help keep things moving. </p> <p>For both startup and existing businesses, credit cards serve the same purpose: immediate access to business financing. “The access is sometimes far more important than the actual cost of financing if it immediately benefits their business,” says Wade. “If it takes them a few months to pay it off at a higher interest rate, it’s still worth it.” </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_2fcf2a230b69405ea9b83c53e3cf5050~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_924,h_584,al_c,q_80/file.png" alt="Personal assets, credit, crowdfunding, angel investors, contests, friends & family, loans, presales, grants and bootstrapping are options for raising money for business."></figure><h2>6 alternative sources of small business funding</h2> <p>According to the SBA, only <a href="https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/15122206/FinanceFAQ-Final-Feb2022.pdf" target="_blank" >10% of small businesses</a> used venture capitalism, grants and crowdfunding to start a business. Highly scalable businesses like tech or product startups primarily use these options. “Most small businesses don’t take on angel investors or VCs,” says Wade. “Your local dry cleaner or hardware store wouldn’t be in the market unless they were expanding rapidly in an area.” </p> <p>If you have big ambitions for your small business, try one of these alternative business financing options:</p> <h3>01. Crowdfunding</h3> <p><a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/09/what-is-crowdfunding/" target="_blank" >Crowdfunding</a> uses online fundraising tools to gradually raise small funding amounts from many different people. Just figure out how much you’ll need to get your business off the ground, choose a suitable <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2019/05/best-crowdfunding-sites/" target="_blank" >crowdfunding site</a> and develop a marketing strategy to boost your fundraiser’s visibility.</p> <h3>02. Angel investors</h3> <p>An <a href="https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/angel-investors" target="_blank" >angel investor</a> uses their own wealth to finance <a href="https://nvca.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NVCA-2021-Yearbook.pdf" target="_blank" >startups in the early stages of development</a> in return for stock or equity. This financing option appeals to businesses because angel investors can provide mentorship and often don’t require repayment if your company fails. Still, their stock or equity gives them some control over your business, so you’ll want to vet angels as carefully. If you can’t find any investors in your own personal network, search sites like <a href="https://www.angelinvestmentnetwork.us/" target="_blank" >Angel Investment Network</a> and <a href="https://angel.co/" target="_blank" >AngelList</a>.</p> <h3>03. Venture capitalists</h3> <p>While angel investors fund starting businesses, <a href="https://www.business.com/articles/angel-investors-vs-venture-capitalists/" target="_blank" >venture capitalists</a> (or VCs) tend to focus on scalable startups. Because they work in partnerships or firms, VCs can offer more money and resources than angel investors and can take on riskier endeavors. They don’t require repayment, but they often require a controlling interest in the company. You can find venture capitalists through the <a href="https://www.sba.gov/partners/sbics/apply-be-sbic" target="_blank" >SBA’s investment program</a>, the <a href="https://nvca.org/" target="_blank" >National Venture Capital Association</a> or <a href="https://gust.com/" target="_blank" >Gust</a>. </p> <h3>04. Incubators</h3> <p>A <a href="https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/business-incubator" target="_blank" >business incubator</a> is a commercial workspace for new ventures to grow into successful businesses over a short time period. The incubator will support your business through its early stages, offering everything from equipment and mentorship to marketing and administrative support. Check out the<a href="https://inbia.org/" target="_blank" > International Business Innovation Association (InBIA)</a>—which claims to be the largest member-based entrepreneurial support network in the world—to find an incubator that fits your business. </p> <h3>05. Grants</h3> <p>Grants offer businesses freedom, but they are rare and competitive. The federal government offers a few grant programs, but many are for research and innovation. You might have more luck with private grants that offer opportunities for traditional small businesses, such as the Walmart Local Community Grants or Amazon’s Black Business Accelerator Program. Check out the US Chamber of Commerce’s list of <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/co/run/business-financing/government-small-business-grant-programs" target="_blank" >federal and private grants</a> to learn more.</p> <h3>06. Product presales</h3> <p>If your business will launch a particular product, you can invite future customers to pay ahead to fund your production and distribution costs. This business funding strategy helps gauge public interest in your product and help you avoid under- or over-production. </p> <figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5af200_2a0d09728dba463da9d4f62042fa084a~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_60,h_60,al_c,q_80/file.png" ></figure><p><strong>By Emily Shwake</strong></p> <p>Wix Blog Writer</p> ]]>
